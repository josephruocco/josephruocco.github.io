      		<h1>Hi, I'm Joe.</h1>
              <p>To Live life with conviction</p>
<p>That's the point.</p>
<p>When I was first developing my healthy habits, every day I would look at myself in the mirror and say, "Can I be convicted of being a healthy person?"

</p>
<p>I do the same with my work, my family, my relationships, and on and on.</p><p>So then you might ask, how do I do?</p>
<p>That is, how do you commit to doing the actions everyday that make you the person you want to be?</p>
<p>That's where I can help.</p>

<p>
The purpose of this website is simple: how do I, Joe Ruocco, do the things I want to do, and how do I do them in a way that doesn’t require any extra time or effort on my part other than a 5% change in my routine.

</p><p>But first, let me take a step back to fully introduce myself.</p>

        <h1>A little More About Me</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Born in Brooklyn. Still here.</li>
  <li>I picked up piano and guitar at age 7. My teacher (my aunt) gave me my first taste of deliberate practice. I was also doing Cub Scouts &amp; Boy Scouts.</li>
  <li>When I was in the seventh grade I started skipping recess to go to the computer lab. I started to learn C++ via NewBoston. </li>

<li>
	2010: Started working. Made $10 an hour in a kitchen. 
</li>
  <li> I took Barbara Oakley’s Learning How To Learn (Highly Recommended). Discovered Massive Online Open Courseware, (MOOCS). Itunes U, Udacity, Coursera.</li>
  
  <li>I think I was like 14, I decided I wanted to be a musician. That didn't pan out. Found my way into Self-Help. Started reading Austin Kleon, Ryan Holiday, et al.</li>
  <li>2016: Ignored all of my school reading to read books I was actually interested in. Bought books, then food and clothes. Decided to shift my life a bit. Took a Coursera Certification course in Java (Duke University)</li>

        <h1>So What Now?</h1>

   <p>For the last five years, self-help is what I've committed myself to doing</p>

<h3>What I've learned in short</h3>
<ol>
    <li>That if you think you can change, you can change</li>
<li>The Huge Research behind Deliberate Practice</li>
<li>To use Systems (Habits, Routines) over Goals for the Long Time.</li>
<li>To stack my life with as many easy, little 1% changes that I can to create massive change.</li>
    </ol>

<p>To simplify everything I learned, I thought up this simple acronym: S.T.R.I.D.E to help anyone learn and remember how to build life changing habits.</p>

<p>STRIDE basically is six adjectives that describe strong habits, and give you a framework to make habits of your own.</p>
<ol>
	<li><b>Small</b>: Keep what you're trying to do easy. It shouldn't take (at first) more than 5 minutes a day to do.: </li>
    <li><b>Triggerable</b>: You established beforehand what time and place and things you need to do your practice. You've made all these things visible and obvious.</li>
    <li><b>Rewarding</b>: You gift yourself a tiny reward- a break, a piece of candy, etc- for doing your habit. Or you pair the habit that you're trying to do with a habit that you find rewarding (watching TV while exercising)</li>
    
<li><b>Irreversible</b>: It's hard to do your habit, and it's hard to fall back into old ways. e.g. You clean out your fridge of bad foods, or you make a bet with your friends to commit to exercising.</li>
<li><b>Daily</b>: This is the most important feature. Consistency. Even if you do the smallest possible bit of what you're trying to do, <b>you're reaffirming that you identify with this new behavior</b></li>
    <li><b>Effective</b>: You keep searching for ways to improve. You find mentors, You measure your current activity and compare yourself to your past self.</li>

</ol>

    <h1>What I'm working on...</h1>
    <p>80% of my time I am working on this site. Please feel free to click around, use my method, grab some free content, or sign up for my newsletter.</p>

<p>I also (20%) work on coding projects. They are more for my own entertainment, so I may or may not put them out there.</p>

<p>In the last few years I've been enraptured by learning the tools of the trade.</p>

<p>If you're interested in learning how to program, here are some things I highly recommend you look into learning:</p>
<ul> 
	<li>
        Emacs: an open source, highly configurable text editor
      </li>  
    <li>
        Ubuntu Linux: an open source, (user friendly?) operating system
        </li>
    <li>Jekyll: a static website engine that I built this site on.</li>
    <li>Github: a "social network" of sorts for programmers</li>
</ul>
