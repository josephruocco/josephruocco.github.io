#+TITLE: What Modernity Silences


Modernity shuts out qualities of Nature that are fatally ignored. 
- commoditization over realtionships - 
- life is more random than we think. 
- sterilizes the randomness of real life with simplified models -
  gyms, schools, prediction models, etc. Modernity seeks to deprive us of life's innate sense of variability
and randomness. When forced to overcompensate we become better off
when not under such conditions.
- Talk is a lot cheaper. /Looking good is more important than doing good/
- product for process - what makes you a hero is how you fight, not if
  you win.
