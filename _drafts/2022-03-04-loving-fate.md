title: More than Mere Indifference.

The Buddhist teaching of indifferenc to the events of fate strikes a
chord in Western Stoicism.

The character Siddhartha in Hermen Hesse\'s Novel declares that \"I can
think, I can wait, I can fast\". And when his questioner finds this
incredulous, the ascetic defends his view:

It is very good, sir. When a person has nothing to eat, fasting is the
smartest thing he could do. When, for example, Siddhartha hadn't learned
to fast, he would have to accept any kind of service before that day is
up, whether it may be with you or wherever, because hunger would force
him to do so. But like this, Siddhartha can wait calmly, he knows no
impatience, he knows no emergency, for a long time he can allow hunger
to besiege him and can laugh about it. This, sir, is what fasting is
good for.

Siddharthas Laughs. Troubles can\'t hurt him. He won\'t play someone\'s
elses game.

The character of the stoics is even stronger. The stoics say f\*\*\* you
to fate.
