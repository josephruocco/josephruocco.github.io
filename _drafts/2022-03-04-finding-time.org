#+TITLE: Finding Time 


Do things that serve a purpose and that you enjoy doing for it's own
sake. 

Life is meant to be savoured, not rushed thorugh. 

Don't something that you need to speedread, don't watch a video that
you have to watch at 2x, 

If you're not fully engaged or easily distracted, (if you have to
listen to music while doing something), switch to a better way or do
something else. 

How Productive you are might just mean how good you are at forcing
yourself to do something you don't like doing.

The optimal path is never the shortest one.
