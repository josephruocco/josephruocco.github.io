## The Skeptic And The Empiric: What\'s Worth Knowing {#the-skeptic-and-the-empiric-whats-worth-knowing .unnumbered}

## Inside and Outside the Veil of Opacity.

-   We Know waht we don\'t like more than what we like,

-   In the real world, truth is secondary to consequence. Whats the
    price of your opinion? Can you afford to have an opinion if you\'re
    not willing to pay the price?

-   I\'ve been struggling with the notion of opinion and belief.Seems to
    me that the words are thrown around a lot interchangeably with
    little hardly any nuance

-   It appears to me that they (opinion/belief) can be used to mean the
    same thing. Where opinion/belief are inextricably tied is not about
    right/wrong but the payoff space. I don\'t want to be right more
    than i want to survive. Opinions are dangerous to have if it means
    the harm could be severly consequential.

-   Claims to knowledge risk A. the conesquences of you being right
    versus wrong, and B.,mistaking evidence of absence for absence of
    evidence

-   Errors of oopinions -\> having an opinion based on confirmatory
    evidence is not scientific. This suggests taht we have an opinion
    first and then just find the data to back it up. Rather than the
    reverse.

-   The Trial of Disconfirmation -\> In some areas of life, The
    Consequencse of who\'s right or wring is like pulling the trigger in
    russian roulette- \> We pay a heavy irreversable price to be wrong.
    Highly risk conscientious. Teh OPinions that are the cornerstone
    fonudation need to be solid. Having an Antecedent in Tradition is a
    good hedge.

-   Judging someone on their belief is not scientific. When we have
    beliefs, we don\'t formulate them based on evidence but rather
    personal leannings. You can\'t reason someone else\'s unreason.
    Accepting beliefs freely. Doing things on faith

-   Having as few beliefs as necessary. - Means that the more beliefs
    you hold onto the more hidden uncertainties (risks) can be hidden.

    -   More information is toxic. 1% of beliefs account for 99% of
        survival rate.

-   There\'s no difference bteween risk and uncertainty - what you
    don\'t know. What claims can you make about what you don\'t know -
    the unobservable, the universal. Faced against the limits of our
    perceptions, our ablitiy to observe, to measure, to predict, etc.

-   Models are of little use. Fictions give as an illusion of control,
    an illusion of certainty, when we need to just accept that no belief
    can tell us

-   IT\'s better to go looking for what\'s wrong with your model then
    keeping your fingers crossed hoping your model is okay.

-   Time shows us what models are useful. The point of religion isn\'t
    to tell us what\'s \"true\" - it\'s to provide a model that\'s
    useful to survival. Promote ethics that are befitting to survival.

-   Respect for people who say \'I don\'t know\' - about predictions,
    about opinions.

-   Remaining highly paranoid/skeptical about fragility. In life you
    need to remain extremely paranoid about the 1% of decisions that can
    be extremely risky/ volatile. What you commit to- your
    health/lifestyle, your relationships, Treat the safeguarding of ruin
    as insurance and then carry on without worry.

-   Knowledge without all the facts - better to do things we don\'t know
    than to explain things we don\'t know how to do? If it makes sense,
    don\'t do it.

-   News/Etc / - Illusion of control about the future. Looking back at
    the past makes it seem like we know it all along, but that\'s not
    true. Narrative Fallacy. History textbooks, suffer this looking back
    and seeing the formulation of events. - Compare this with wheer we
    are now, the future still unknown, where tomorrow everything might
    change.

-   Skeptic Tranquilily: Accepting that the future isn\'t under your
    control, there isn\'t much we can predictably foresee, and that life
    is more random than you think.

-   Various reasons to consider about conusming unsolicited opinions:
    Opinions

    1.  Preferences. Just do what you like, Don\'t do what you think you

    should do. There is hardly more to worry about in life than doing
    something that you prefer. More information isn\'t helpful -, widely
    distributed information isn\'t helpful, the future isn\'t
    foreseable, the past can\'t be narratively formulated, About matters
    outside the fold, Just go with what feels right.

    -   I\'m not trying to conivince you to not have opinions, but to be
        wary of people\'s opinions, is essentially the ability of a
        skeptic. To train your ear to filter opinions by seeing the
        unobserviable
    -   Hidden Incentives of Opinion Givers:

-   quick and dirty heuristics are better than theories. Simple problems
    can\'t be solved with complex soltuions.

    There are errors made belief/knowledge

The Observable / UnObservable, Belief

-   Unquestionably, the basis for belief, or a proposition, (True/False)
    is evidence.
-   For a sketpic, holding down a belief/opinion is hard to do. There\'s
    unobservables

No belief

The truth APpearences/ phenomena are observable, but hardly true. Belief

## Ignorance and Paranoia

-   The More You Know, the more ignorant you feel.

-   One Day you could lose more money than you\'ve ever made in your
    whole life.

-   Withholding Judgement: From an Eastern fable, the old farmer does
    not think \"this is bad\" when the horse breaks his son\'s legs. As
    it turns out, the son\'s broken legs prevented him from being
    drafted when the country went to war. And so on.

-   Cognitive Distortions: We think we can predict the future, (which we
    can\'t) Something completely unexpected and unpredictable happens,
    then in hindsight it appears to as if we could\'ve seen it coming
    all along.

-   Those who care about survival care little about being right or
    wrong, true or false. When survival matters most, Better to be
    \"wrong\" most times and be right when it matters. Then to be right
    most times and survive then being \"right\" and dead

-   Mistake a rope for a snake than a snake for a rope are irreversible.
    Better the former. The key to understanding is where you can\'t
    afford to be wrong. Because we are fragile to snakes, terrorists,
    etc. justifies hyper paranoia ... The small probability of being
    right avoiding irreversible negative consequences, so it pays to be
    wrong most times.

-   It makes sense to act predicated on (probabilistically) wrong
    beliefs where the single \"right\" outcomes are severe.

-   It\'s unenthical to advocate an opinion that you yourself can gain
    from while avoiding associtaed harm.

## *How to Be A Good Lover, or, Trust & Knowledge in the Information Age*

We exist in a world where some situations are dominated by the singular
occurances of rare events. Consider that even if you cheat on your
spouse only once in the duration of relationship, *you are not going to
be in a relationship for much longer* [^1] How fragile is the system to
extreme variatians?

What we can learn from such an incident:

-   *Emotional Sugarcoating* We avoid silent evidence of other people
    who may have been in the same situtaion.
-   *Asymmetry of Knowledge* A feature fo this to natice is that once
    the truth is revealed, one person is surprised and another isn\'t.
    Knowledge of rare events is relevant to your expectation.
-   *Equality under Uncertainty* What people who have been through
    affairs know that others don\'t is that

```{=html}

```
-   *Who does Advice really help?* Beware advice. There are hidden
    pitfalls underneath this kind of information that makes the one who
    presents advice /posit

iva/ could give harm to the one who receives it without recourse.

-   *Advice on Jumping into a Volcano* Situations like the relationship
    one- suffering the problem of infidelity, or others largely
    unpredictable - we can\'t see. We only sample the traits of
    successful individuals from a sample of successful individuals,
    ignoring the ones who used those traits but didn\'t end up so lucky.
    I haven\'t seens too many interviews with skydivers who\'s
    parachutes didn\'t open or with pilots who crash their plans.

    -   *Look at what they do* Another trick is to never trust the
        beautiful philosopher. To filter the credibility of advice,
        don't take advice from the poster child of their profession. If
        they don't play the role or speak the jargon, that means that
        their skill speaks for them. There is an asymmetry between
        givers of "positiva,"

    -   (Do This) prescriptive advice as they do not incur the harm you
        would from following their advice. Avoid commentary from anyone
        who has to feed their family. Unsuccessful people give the most
        advice.

-   *The Trouble With Athiest Economists* Due to the natuer of rare
    events, and the impossiblity to predict them due to their
    *infintissimally small* odds, forecasting is in reality just a
    vulgar illusion of control. IF you want an illusion of control,
    start going to church on Sundays. Necktie-wearing economists can\'t
    be trusted who still get paid even if you blow up. In fact, how much
    worse is it that we still listen to predictions in light of how
    little we can be sure of?

    -   *The Advice Business*

## *How to Become An Entrepreneur in 10 Steps*

-   *The Stanford Business School 5-Step Entrepreneurial Program* The
    most recent business best seller/ 5-step program is commiditized
    knowledge. It\'s incredulious to believe that a course *anyone has
    access to*, a YouTube video *anyone could watch* could proffer any
    knowledge of real value.
    -   /Advice and Lotto Tickets- Another factor that makes advice hard
        to translate is luck and randomness. Most communicated advice is
        flawed: Even if the giver of the advice is innocuous, advice is
        like handing you the numbers to their winning lottery ticket. We
        don\'t see the people who failed with this advice.
    -   *Rare Knowledge is Valuable*
    -   *Business is predicated on Discovery* What a million people know
        isn\'t worth knowing. Any real vaule of a business is based on
        discovering a \"secret,\" - that is, somehting not many people
        know or believe to be true. Real value is made through
        Differentitade, rare, inimitable qualities of businesses.
        One-in-a-kind products.
    -   *Business Plans* Business PLans are faulty thinking. THis was
        the case for Coca Cola, Tiffany, Kodak, and Aspirin.
    -   
    -   *Trial and Error/Empricism/Practice Over Theories* You can learn
        creative experimentation can lead to outcomes you can\'t
        predict. Feel free to take all matter of risk in this domain.

## *No Grand Theory of Everything*

-   *Life is Not A Story* A consequence of seeing the world through your
    own mind is suffering from the mental distortion our memory of
    events and emotions through time all human beings do. We see the
    past through a narrative lens (most historical records, news,
    journalism, etc) and the future vicariously through another story
    (our plans, forecasts, etc). Life is such that the future will bring
    events we\'ve never seen before and we look at the past as if we
    could\'ve known it all along. A diary retells the past from the
    present prspective without retelling a narrative. Avoid planning,
    maximize *optionality*, (More on that later)

-   *Is A Wrong Map Better than No Map?*

-   *Get Better at Saying \"I Don\'t Know\"*

-   *Too Early to Judge* Sextus represented and jotted down the ideas of
    the school of the Pyrrhonian skeptics who were after some form of
    intellectual therapy resulting from the suspension of belief. Do you
    face the possibility of an adverse event? Don't worry. Who knows, it
    may turn out to be good for you. Doubting the consequences of an
    outcome will allow you to remain imperturbable. The Pyrrhonian
    skeptics were docile citizens who followed customs and traditions
    whenever possible, but taught themselves to systematically doubt
    everything, and thus attain a level of serenity. But while
    conservative in their habits, they were rabid in their fight against
    dogma.

## *Knowledge Through Subtraction*

-   *The Power of Disconfirmation* In life, disconfirmation is more
    rigorous than confirmation. One single piece of disconfirming
    evidence wipes out any prior confirming examples. Reasoning fails in
    extreme domains when we try to go from specific instances to
    categoricals. The importance of discon. is that it lengthens the gap
    in these instances between what you know and what you don\'t know.
    Which as a result a much, much higher premium on what you do not
    know.\
    - 1. Hunting for Counterevidence :: Half of the game is realizing
    that it is about what you don\'t know and what others know is more
    important than the reverse. Or what you dislike and others like
    (hence, your futuer self). Learning is admitting you were wrong.
    Acquire as many books as you can possibly own. Research more you
    disagree with than the reverse. What a million people know isn\'t
    worth knowing. The news isn\'t worth watching. Fed to you via
    algorithm. Only consume information that you seek out. [^2]\

    2\. What We Know Best
    :   Knowledge becomes robust by necessarily knowing what is wrong
        and avoiding it. We get smarter by learning what not to do and
        by avoiding ignorance. We know what is wrong better than what is
        right. Avoid unhappiness than it is to pursue happiness.
        Avoiding ignorant people is easier than surrounding yourself
        with \'intelligent\' ones.\
-   *The Council of Elders*

1.  **Age** - Informatino that has been around a long time will likely
    be around for a lot longer than the new thing. Prune \"news\"
    sources- TV, radio, social media, etc. Trendy information is fragile
    information. Stick to old books. \# 24. Trust the advice of old
    sources (your grandma and old books)

## The Stoic: The Art of Risk-Taking {#the-stoic-the-art-of-risk-taking .unnumbered}

## *How to Become Indestructable*

-   *\'Less Is More\' Rationality* - Rationality is survival of the
    worst case. Rationality is what you do to avoid ruin in the event of
    the worst case. Take steps for your business and life to take care
    of that and the rest takes care of itself. In the real world, the
    worst case is worse than anything you\'ve seen before or could
    reasonably predict. We can use the following rules to increase
    robustness.
    1.  To learn how to survive, learn to respect what has survived. If
        something has been true for a while, and it seems irratinoal,
        you have the wrong definition of rationality.
    2.  Redundancy & Applications. We can learn from Mother Nature that
        aggressive redundancy can best prepare us for an unknowable
        future.
        -   Backups. As they say among military groups, \'Two is One and
            One is None.\' Redundancy in the cash under the mattress is
            security against an unpredictable future. Expecting fragile
            objects to break in only a matter of time is not only wise
            but realistic. Redundancy takes other forms too, like extra
            strength or capacity that makes having it more efficient
            than a preconceived \'optimal\' route.
        -   Functional Redundancy. Meaning that multiple objects can
            perform the same function. Eyes can hear by reading lips.
            Smell enhances taste. Your copy of *War And Peace* can be
            used as a doorstop. Your Diploma of Graduation in Russian
            Comparative Literature can be used as a mousepad.
        -   Decision Making. Redundancy can take the form of having
            multiple options. With uncertainty, the best decision at any
            time allows us to change course when new information
            surfaces. This means not letting goals or destinations make
            us blind to new and better options.
            -   Listening to Instincts (Procrastination & Forgetfulness)
                Make decisions as late as possible.
            -   Less Is More - Never Convince yourself to do something.
                If you have more than one reason, don\'t do it. Nobody
                says: \"this man is a criminal, he killed 20 people, and
                he has bad breath.\" The more convincing you need the
                worse the
    3.  *Risk Taking* There is no such thing as failure, only death.
        Which is happening anyway.
    4.  At the end of the day, you are the one to determine your risk
        level. Avoid taking so much risk that you lose sleep at night.

## *Modernity & Domain Depedence*

-   *Overcompensation* Modernity seeks to deprive us of life\'s innate
    sense of variability and randomness. When forced to overcompensate
    we become better off when not under such conditions.

    1.  Human bones are strengthened through episodic stress. Falling
        asleep is easier with background noise.
    2.  Interpersonal relationships are well maintained when problems
        (and conversations) are had early.
    3.  Innovation and Discovery. Innovation happen through aggressive
        trial and by accident, discovering a product or use of a product
        never seen before. Increase your exposures and fail early and
        cleanly. Creativity is your number of trials.
    4.  The uberwealth of cities on the East Coast as a motivator
        compensates for the bad weather, lack of scenic Nature, and
        miserable train rides.

-   *Skin in the Game & Barbells* Risk taking, at any level, means
    having something to lose. Being hyper paranoid against real, ruinous
    risks does not mean you lack courage. Prudence is courage of the
    general. Setting those limits for risks you cannot tolerate enables
    you to be be maximally aggressive in those areas where you can. In
    the next sections we will explore how to effectively be hyper
    paranoid and hyper aggressive with the mind and body against the
    mediocre, \"average\" domains of gyms, classrooms, modern nutrition,
    etc.

-   *Education* Curriculums suffers from one-size-fits-all effect. On
    average the knowledge you learn in schools is of little copmetitve
    value. To reverse this effect, learn with the mind\'s natural senses
    of boredom and curiosity.

    1.  *Learning With Emotions* In Part 1, it was shown that Knowledge
        that is worth knowing is as far from the center as possilbe.
        What will take you there is through undirected trial-and-error.
        -   *Risk Makes Things Interesting* Learn out of necessity.
            Learn to solve a problem or out of interest, never out of
            obligation. When we have something to lose, or risk failure,
            we become desparately to find out as much as we can about a
            subject. Much like the pilot of a plane is maximally
            paranoid or an addict\'s cunning comes from to procure
            drugs.
        -   *Avoiding Boredom* If you get bored easily that means your
            *b\*\*\*t* detector is functioning properly. Evaluate
            curiosity daily, Read accordingly. Notice when you a book
            starts to bore you. As soon as that\'s the case, switch to
            another book. (This is where it is extremely helpful but not
            necessary to own a lot of books ) Don\'t read something that
            you need to speedread, don\'t watch a video that you have to
            watch at 2x, If you\'re not fully engaged or easily
            distracted, find a better way or don\'t do it. [^3] If
            schools wanted to resemble real life, they would only care
            about the subject in which the stduent has the highest grade
            and ignore the others, In a convex world, the average is of
            zero significance.

    ```{=html}
    <!-- -->
    ```
    1.  *Books & Real Friends* Get to know books as you would friends,
        get to know them a little at a time. The test of whether you
        really liked a book is to reread it; the test of whether you
        really like someone's. Company is if you are ready to meet him
        again and again. Friendship that ends never was one, any book
        not worth rereading isn't worth reading. The number of books you
        finished reading through once this year has as much meaning as
        the number of people you met once and never saw again. Seek the
        ones that will stick around for a long time.

    2.  *Leisure is Fertile without Distraction* The mind is most
        intelligent while devoted to effortless activity. When freed
        from constraints, work, schedules, the mind discoveries
        opportunities that it didn\'t see before. As anyone who might
        have taken a shower before would realize. Go for a walk without
        a phone, without listening to music. [^4]

-   *Diet and Exercise* Diets & Exercise Regimens tax the body with
    chronic stressors. Gyms are sterilized environments that work one
    muscle at a time, making the part stronger at teh expense of the
    whole. Diets through modern constructions rely on strong willed
    moderation instead of randomized fasting and volume intake. To
    simulate natural exercise and dietary conditions, try Hiking on
    rocky trails with steep inclines. Deadlift your maxlift on a
    barbell. Never eat foods out of a box, and avoid modernized diet
    foods. Randomly skip meals, and work out when hungry.

## *Acceptance of Fate*

-   *Abandoning Hope* Try to kill anything called hope in you. You never
    want to put yourself in a sutiation where you wish very badly for
    something specific to happen to you, an event where tomorrow would
    suddenly make a big difference for the rest of your life.

    -   say, the outcome of a job interview, a lawsuit, winning the
        lotto, meeting a significant other, getting a paper accepted,
        have gold rise, your boss dies, or other events that can
        markedly change your life. If this is the case for you are
        royally enslaved to circumstances.
    -   Take good events when they happen, but don\'t depend on them
        like a loser.
    -   Organize yourself in a way to not have to dream for a better
        tomorrow or day after.
    -   Life is happening to you right now. Hope is like banging on the
        locked door trying to get out, opening it only to find that *the
        door opens outward*

-   *Competition & Playing Your Own Game* Everyone is trying to be the
    best, or top 1% percent. Few are trying to do what they like
    regardless of what everyone else does. Competition is for chasing
    the preferences of others; playing someone else's game. The squeeze
    you feel is them putting you into their box. Their rules, their way,
    their game. There are no rules, no boundaries. Play your game; not
    theirs. You have a real life if and only if you do not compete with
    anyone in any of your pursuits.

    -   *Personal Dignity* A moment about Saying f\*\*k you to fate.
        Should fate turn against you, do not play victim. Do not
        complain. Be worthy. As with the Sour Grapes from Aesop's fable,
        fate can hold the grapes out of reach, but we get to decide
        whether or not they are sour. Rejecting the grapes outright is
        in itself its own more rewarding. It is hard to lose at your own
        game.

don\'t change the rules just because they odds are against you.

this is no failure, only death. which is happening anyway.

## The Epicurean: The Pursuit of Happiness {#the-epicurean-the-pursuit-of-happiness .unnumbered}

## *Happiness As the Ancients Knew It*

-   *Happiness & Commiditization* You can\'t buy happiness, so avoid
    people who are trying to sell it and avoid pursuing it.

    1.  *Forgot Modern Happiness* - Modern thought is grounded in the
        objective of maximizing \"happiness\" utility\", \"success\" or
        similar amtters that are both selfish and over which you have
        little control. Switch your objective to maximize \"pride\" and
        see how different-- and more controllable-- things become. The
        more you pay for luxury, the more inflamed you will feel when
        there are minor imperfection. True happiness is restful sleep,
        frequent laughs, meals with friends, afternoon naps, good
        coffee, gratitude, and a clear conscience.

    2.  *Frequency of Pleasures* The Things you like you also like at a
        given frequency. Junk FOOD/JUNK INFORAMTION IS enjoyed best when
        kept restrained to a weekly \"cheat day\" than moderately
        throughout.

    3.  *The Essence of Life is Some Volatility* NO cheese no desert and
        no manmade cuisine on the planet will be able to surpass in
        taste the simplest food we get after an episode of hunger; and
        no liquid will ever improve on the taste of water after a
        prolonged period of thirst. The best days can be recovering a
        lost wallet or phone. The greatest acts of kindness you
        expericnec may be from total strangers.

    4.  *Vacationing* It\'s foolish to complain you don\'t have enough
        time. We shouldn\'t know when the week begins or ends. Not being
        prisoner to a schedule ro calendar, an alarm clock or
        wristwatch. Rehearsed conversations, rehearsed laughs. if luxury
        is not creating more and more varied options for life, you\'re
        doing it wrong.

    5.  *Freedom* When you can do things without any explanation. That
        you like doing just for the sake of doing it, that\'s freedom.

-   *The Misery of Optimization* A word on the major difference is
    optimize (try for better) versus satisfice (say good enough).

    -   *Ignoring the Collective* The central flaw with optimizing is
        that \"everything else\" ceases to exist, and makes people think
        the individual, not the collective, is the true unit. The
        collective is more important than the individual. We are more
        important than me. Not just the loss of your life, but one that
        lies in a broader set of people, one that includes a family, a
        community, a tribe, a fraternity.

    -   *The Promise of Marshmallows* In popular psychology there\'s
        \'the Marshmallow Test\' or something, which participants choose
        between a single marshmallow at the the start or can opt to wait
        15 minutes to receive an additional one. The truth about life is
        that we aren\'t guaranteed the second marshmallow. Carefully
        consider what is worth delaying gratification for. With things
        like feeling happiness, having a romantic partner, getting a
        Nobel or A Booker where luck plays a large role (hidden or
        forgotten).

## *Long Time Friends*

-   *Logic of Arguing* Don\'t reason with someone about something they
    didn\'t reason themselves into. Arguing and winning an argument are
    two different things.
-   *Whom to Respect*
-   *Conduct Among Your Peers* Never status signal or wealth signal.

## *Engagement*

[^1]: If you\'re in a relationship that tolerates infidelity, you
    shouldn\'t be in that relationship. Also, I don\'t remember who to
    credit this to. It\'s a slight variation of the Turkey Problem.

[^2]: The Information age equivalent of \'only eat what you kill.\'

[^3]: *A note on addiction, distraction, boredom, & laziness* Not to be
    misunderstood. Manufactured modern distractions feed our addictions
    to novelty. *Pursuing these distractions is not avoiding boredom*

[^4]: Recently Meditation practices have become commonplace for
    addictive \'self-improvement\' type As. While it\'s literally doing
    nothing, purpotedly that\'s still better than the information most
    people consume.
