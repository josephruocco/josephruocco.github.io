#+TITLE: The Thirst for Chance 

The essence of Life is light volatility.

NO cheese no desert and no manmade cuisine on the planet will be able
to surpass in taste the simplest food we get after an episode of
hunger; and no liquid will ever improve on the taste of water after a
prolonged period of thirst. 

The best days can be recovering a lost wallet or phone. The greatest
acts of kindness you expericnec may be from total strangers. 

When we have something to lose, or risk failure, we become
desparately to find out as much as we can about a subject. Much like
the pilot of a plane is maximally paranoid or an  addict's cunning
comes from to procure drugs. 

Learn out of necessity.
