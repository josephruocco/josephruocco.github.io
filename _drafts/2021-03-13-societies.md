Beliefs are everywhere in every society. Groups promoting their beliefs. And with some groups, these
beliefs are unorthodox. They throw off conventional wisdom and express a view of the world that tries
to push society forward. These unconventional thinkers and their groups wishing to survive and promote
their beliefs in mainstream society face challenges. Because swimming against the current could drown you.



[ This is an essay about antinormative beliefs, groups of people, and the what to think
of groups that operate on antinormative beliefs. All thoughts are expressively my own. I have
no ties to silicon valley.]



- startup: a blend of people willing to throw off conventional wisdom and discover profound
new ways of looking at the world.

a few definitions as well.

- antinormative beliefs:
- operational success/failure
- society-  social contract
- state of nature
- skin in the game.


there's no death penalty for failing to create a startup.
nevertheless, it's exceedingly difficult to pull one off. 

Hobbe's state of nature.

- state of naturish, there isn't much else to do other than what everyone else is doing.
theres not enough enablers to do such things and you'd have to be really stupid,
because either you believe our religion, or die

y axis - operational success and failure
x axis - free people willingly buying into anti normative beliefs 

individual -> dogma -> school -> startup -> religion -> cult


First, start at the ends.

1. operational failures

cult
- no dissenting voice
- no exposure to outside beliefs
- participants are not free, by virtue of the fact that
their beliefs are not their own. the beliefs are implanted 

the startling thing about the scientologist movie was
that the inmates of the cell were *fighting* to stay in scientology. 

radical individual
- has beliefs all of their own,
- an enligthened individual of sorts 

wishy-washy disciples
- the 12 apostles knew they had to lower the bar from being too cultish. 
- Orthodox Judaism sects believe that unless a kosher EMT is present
no medical technician should be allowed to interfere with the victim.

"schools" of thought, i.e. Plato's school of wisdom, etc. the Junto,
and even the schools most of us went to

apostalates - die with me.


operational success: startup 

this is water moment:you can still use a flip phone, but all of your friends have iphones.
That is when Apple has accomplished the impossible.
When everyone has a PC in their house, that is when the impossible has been done.
When everyone has an electric car in their driveway, and you have to go searching for a gas station,
which if this holds true, will be the next 


Reflection: are we reeling in the future in or pushing it forward?

Musk is not simply building
theres skin in the game with taht, because he is living or dying based on the notion that everyone
will eventually resort to using electric vehicles/technologies/etc if a multitude of factors support that notion,
if Ford doesn't make money on its hybrid, it's still selling plenty of gas vehicles to keep itself afloat.
Thus the risk that startups face that is tremendous, but the payoff is progress.

How can The first world can have hold to things like "ending starvation" when the reality is that McDonald's is just champing
the notion that fattening, highly caloric food should be cheaply available. No one is pretending like their doing a public service.
Yet, some will say that we've "solved" starvation in the first world.
