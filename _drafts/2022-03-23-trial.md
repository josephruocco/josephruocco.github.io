title: Trial & Error and Computational Irreducibility

The biggest changes to our quality of life came from tinkerers.

Entrepreneurs, inventors, Designers and Artists,

Whatever your Creative pursuits lead you, -- the biggest payoffs come
from being maximally experimental.

Aggressive Trial and Error leads to discovery.

Creativity is your number of trials.

Stephen Wolfram has this idea of computational irreducibility - which,
in this context, means *you don\'t know what doing each trial will take
you until you do it*

Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again.

That\'s not the case with volatile domains.

Emphasizing the necessity of unsuccessful trials in creative process,
Popper identifies two distinguishing traits of creative minds:

-   Persistence, coming from an intense interest in the problem,
    guaranteeing that a large number of hypotheses (solutions) are tried

-   A wider range of sources from which the trials (ideas) are selected,
    coming from the variety of one's experience and interactions

Human mind has a hard time understanding nonlinearities. - Water has a
certain boiling point, and so do we.

How far are you willing to go?
