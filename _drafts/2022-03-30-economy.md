Ratinoality sanctifies Truth and Falsehood.

In reality, Truth and Falsehood are both irrelevant.

There are opinions about matters of no consequence. When conseqeunce is
all that matters.

Opinions just get you into arguments. There is a differenc between
winning an arguement and winning.

Hold less beliefs - even less in belief itself. It doesn\'t matter as
much as you believe.
