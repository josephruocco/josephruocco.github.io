*On Cicero arriving at the tomb of Archimedes* In Cicero\'s *On Old
Age*, he recounts seeing the tomb of archimedes, the godfather of
Mathematics, shrouded in overgrowth.

As the old saying goes, Those who fail to learn what our ancestors know
are doomed to repeat it.

More importantly, let us focus on what they *did*, not what they thought
they knew or what historians thought they thought they knew.

Mother Nature leaves hints, traces. Instincts. The obvious answers are
hidden in plain sight.

In practice, Our ancestors focused on survival. Our ancestors listened
to Mother nature. We are foolish not to heed these lessons.
