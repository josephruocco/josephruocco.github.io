** Writing & NoteTaking 
- emacs//org mode//notes app//screenshots 
- Mac Terminal
- Arch Linux on a Dell Latitude Computer. I love the startup
  environment being just a blank terminal, I can write without any
  other utility. Also using a Dell is useful because I use an ethernet
  to plug in to the internet, thus making the choice to use the
  interent more deliberate than automatic behavior of WiFi.

  domain. Customized Lanyon/Poole Theme

- focus app- set on hardcore mode to limit internet usage to 2 hours 
- Freedom app which blocks distracting websites. 
- KSafe 
- Airpods - used with Siri to make/answer calls & reduce phone
  pickup. 
- Spotify for music. Discovery: it helps to use tho web player on your
  phone instead of the app so you can singletask better. 
** Misc 
- Drawing, I used to use a Wacom Bamboo tablet, on ClipStudio Paint
  for Mac, but then just switched to the better feeling Apple
  Pencil/Ipad and Clip Studio Ipad App. (Unpaid version)
- Music - M-audio Oxygen and garageband.
