title: "Why (Most) Advice Fails" 
layout: page

To succeed in a spectacular fashion you had to be spectacularly unusual.

An Entrepreneurial bootcamp is an oxymoron.

With Wealth or health, the attempts to commiditize these things and sell
them and for people to buy them is a fooled by randomness problem.

As said before, *what a million people know isn\'t worth knowing* -
It\'s hard to say that these things could proffer any real value.

Any real vaule of a business is based on discovering a \"secret,\" -
that is, somehting not many people know or believe to be true. Real
value is made through Differentitade, rare, inimitable qualities of
businesses. One-in-a-kind products.

What is rare and vaulable is *unknown*, and those dealing it out are
just trying to get rich off of you.

That aside, advice hard to translate is luck and randomness. Most
communicated advice is flawed: Even if the giver of the advice is
innocuous, advice is like handing you the numbers to their winning
lottery ticket. We don\'t see the people who failed with this advice.
