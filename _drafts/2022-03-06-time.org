#+TITLE: Time Filters Knowledge

Not all theories or beliefs are equally valuable. 

Ideas are selected on how well they help us survive. 

The judge of how well they help us survive is time. 

As time goes on, the longer an idea is exposed to the trial of
falsification. It is only a matter of time before someone with fatal
belief exits the gene pool. 

The longer an idea has been around, the longer it will be around. 

Read old books. 

If an idea that you deem "irrational"  has been around for a long
time, then you have the wrong definition of ratinoality. 

Mother Natrue does not make mistakes. /The burden of proof is on us/
