  - 2. What We Know Best :: Knowledge becomes robust by
    necessarily knowing what is wrong and avoiding it. We get smarter by
    learning what not to do and by avoiding ignorance. We know what is
    wrong better than what is right. Avoid unhappiness than it is to
    pursue happiness. Avoiding ignorant people is easier than
    surrounding yourself with 'intelligent' ones. \\
