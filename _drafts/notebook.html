<b>What we know best</b> - Knowledge increases as we remove false,
speculative information. Discomfirmation is more rigorous than
confirmation. At a personal level, We know what we disklike more than
what we like. You are much more likely to improve your life by
removing what you dislike rather than what you think you
like. Avoidance of ignorant people is like being around smart ones.
</p>

<p>
<b>What's Worth Knowing:</b> 1) <b>Time</b> - Informatino that has been around a long
time will likely be around for a lot longer than the new thing. Prune
"news" sources- TV, radio, social media, etc. Trendy information is
fragile information. Stick to old books 2) <b>Distribution</b> -  what a
million people know is not worth knowing. If you know what everyone
else knows, your payoff will be average.  3) <b>corollary:</b> in
conjunction with preferring old books, Acquire as many books as you
can possibly own. What you don't know (and no one else knows) is far
more important than what you do. There is no upper limit to what you
don't know. 4) <b>Learn what can be used immediately.</b> Information not
put to use is wasted. Knowledge that is personally valuable remains
with you. Learn info that you searched for, never what is curated by
an algorithm. 5) <b>Learning is repetition</b> Books are like friends, get
to know them a little at a time. Look through the bibliographies of
your favorite books. The test of whether you really liked a book is to
reread it; the test of whether you really liked someone’s Company is
if you are ready to meet him again and again. Friendship that ends
never was one, any book not worth rereading isn’t worth reading. 
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Reading is for improving the eyes you use to see
the world. Don't read best-sellers. Business books are a
completely eliminated category by bookstores for writings that
have no depth, no style, no empirical rigor and no
sophistication. Read history, (not about the last 50 years),
philosophy, biography, fiction, the hard sciences, and
mathematics. Through learning the basics, it has a place to hook
your understanding. It opens up a world of interestingness.</li>
</ol>


<p>
<b>How Knowledge Cripples us</b> Artificially constructed environments for
the body and mind deprive us of the variablitiy experienced in real
life. This is caled Domain Dependence, and it cripples us.  Martial
arts combat doesn’t train you to a surprise knife or glock in a street
fight. A man checking into a hotel asks the concierge to take your
bags upstairs. Fifteen minutes later, the same man goes to lift free
weights in the hotel gym, replicating with kettlebells natural
exercises as if he were swinging a suitcase. Skills that transfer:
Street fights, off path hiking, seduction, broad erudition. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Adding back volatility</b> 
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Cheat Days An Internet Sabbath cannot by itself cure a distracted
brain. If you eat healthy just one day a week, you’re unlikely to
lose weight. If you spend just one day a week resisting
distraction, you’re unlikely to diminish your brain’s craving for
these stimuli. Instead of scheduling the occasional break from
distraction so you can focus, you should instead schedule the
occasional break from focus to give in to distraction. Schedule in
advance when you’ll use the Internet, and then avoid it altogether
outside these times. Try this for caffeine or junk foods.</li>

<li>Food Restrictions &amp; Volume Variance The food pyramid has been
flipped for the last fifty years. It is easier to fast than to
diet. Eat real foods you enjoy, to prevent you from eating crap.
Eat nothing out of the box. No sugar, bread, or pasta. Avoid
artificial sweeteners. No fruits. Eat very very large meals on
occasion, like Sunday Feasts, while other times skipping meals.</li>
</ol>


<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Exercise &amp; Sleep - Do No Moderate Exercise sessions, either too
little or way too much, with no set schedule. Take Very, very long
walks with Occasional sprints. Do No purely aerobic
exercise. Experience variance in body Temperature. Drink plenty of
water but let yourself become thirsty occasionally. Occasionally
sleep deprived, but default sleep with no alarm clock. If you
don’t know what your problem is, you need to sleep. In the wild,
exercise just happened. Reward comes after exercise not before,
Occasional abundance.</li>
</ol>


<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Walking walk 1-2 hours a day. Go for a walk without your phone.  A
walk is never a waste of time. If you need to listen to music
while walking don’t walk and please don’t listen to music
(see # 21) We are built to room the real world, to have physical
objects, to make physical objects, to meet people in person. This
is the only real life. And there can never be a digital
substitute. Digital is only a supplement.</li>
</ol>



<p>
<b>What Emotions are for:</b> Emotions are biological signals. They can be
used to aid us in decision making and learning 1) <b>Procrastination</b>
Always make decisions at the last minute. Because the longer you wait
the smarter you become. Decisions are best made when the most present
information is available. 2) <b>Boredom</b> - Humans don’t like to do
boring things. The purpose of life should be avoiding boredom, or
using boredom as a biological clock,without being impolite If you get
bored easily, your B***t detector is functioning
properly. Beaureaucrats and executives are best at sitting through
boring meetings and keeping attention on boring tasks. Laziness
is enduring an existence you don’t like and never trying to do anything
about it. You don't get a second chance at life if you knowingly
endure boring things. 3) <b>Forgetfulness</b>- If you forget (some) things,
it means that our mind knows how to filter 4) <b>Uncertainty</b> - The minds
desires  certainty while also craving the delicate chance of
surprise. Avoid planning, Choose the plan that allows for the most
future options. The best days are finding a lost wallet or laptop. 5)
<b>Curiosity</b> — Read what you like until you like to read. The internet is
widening the gap between the curious and the non curious. Evaluate
your curiosity daily, read accordingly. As soon as a book starts to
bore you, switch. There’s  a perfect book for you waiting to be
read. By keeping score of finished books, you won’t find it. Reading
is a journey to find the best books for you. 6) <b>urgency &amp;
distractedness</b> - Deep Learning is never Quickly learned - Trade speed
for depth-peeding and cramming means you aren’t curious. Trade speed
for depth. If you find yourself doing things that require a podcast,
you should ask yourself whether there’s a better way of doing
it. Rushing is short term thinking. Don’t hurry, don’t stop. 
</p>


<p>
<b>When we are  you</b> mind your brain is most intelligent when you don’t
instruct it what to do. Problems will never solved by sitting at a
desk. Idle fascination, letting problems take a back burner that will
surface in the front of your mind when you’re focusing on your problem
head on. -Walking and sleeping are all mysteriously necessary to have a
healthy life.- Shower, exercise, listening to music.  walk,  swim, or
Dance, Enjoy being a passenger in a car or bus. Ride a bike,  Draw or
paint, Take a bath or shower, Listen to music, especially without
words, Play songs you know well on a musical instrument, Meditate or
pray, or take a nap.    
</p>


<ol class="org-ol">
<li>By setting oneself totally free of constraints, free of
thoughts, free of this debilitating activity called work, free
of offers, then mysteries that you never thought existed emerge
in front of your eyes.</li>

<li>Recognizing a new opportunity requires plenty of idle time,
wandering about, tinkering, trial and error, long walks,
randomized attention. And other inefficiencies of that
sort. First step is recognizing the opportunity. Second step is
pouncing on the good ones. Can’t do any of those things if you
squeeze all the idle time out of life.</li>

<b>What Rationality is Good for</b> Take risks, but always be prudent.*
What is rational is that which allows for survival. Uncertainty
doesn’t kill us. Ignoring or not managing it does. What is fragile
has more to lose than to gain Avoid risk of ruin While dealing with
uncertainty, the worst class of risk which you should never tolerate
is those which make you “go bust,” that is,which cause irreversible
injury or death, financial ruin, betrayal of trust, etc. The foremost
easiest way to solve problems is to not have them. Risk taking ain't
gambling.
</p>

<p>
<b>The Practice of Risk Taking</b> - 1. Put your name on it - Having your
name attached to your idea means you have something to lose. Honor
and grandeur is standing up for your opinion at the right
moment. Virtue is a sequence of small acts of omission. 2) Work in
front of others.  (Deeds before Words) Think, Learn, and create for
an audience. Consistently post bits and pieces of your work, your
ideas, and what you’re learning online. It’s works, not words, that
make you earn your title.  The line between private and public
life. You must be consistent with you public ideas and your
private ideas. Never virtue signal, never The best kind of virtue
gets you put on the cross. Be who you are when alone. 3) Non Cheap
Signaling By all means, avoid words. There are two types of people:
those who win and those who try to win arguments. They are never the
same. Don’t argue, either don’t complain or eliminate them. From a
distance you can’t tell what their arguing about, up close they can’t
tell what they’re arguing about either. Being polite to someone who
is arrogant is worse than being arrogant to someone who is polite
Greatness  starts with the replacement of hatred with polite disdain
Never try to convince yourself to  Don’t be nice or try to convince,
the FBI didn’t try to convince the mafia.  Verbal attack is the most
authentic sign of impotence.  You are free in proportion to the
number of people you can say fuck you to but don’t. Never trust
someone who doesn’t have any enemies. Stand up when when others are
afraid for their  reputation  Why should I listen to you if you put
nothing at risk? 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
<b>There is no "failure" for a risk-taker</b> 
</p>

<p>
<b>How Mother Nature Insures Itself</b> In a word: Redundancy.1)  1. Have
 backups. Not just for physical objects but for plans. Redundancy for
 both objects and plans are an aggressive insurance against an
 unknown future. The benefit of freedom to occupy your mind and your
 time with only matters that interest you. 2) Choose plans with the
 most amount of options. Such a life as this finds ourself with a lot
 of Downtime. Keep a notebook with you at all times. Carrying a book
 with you at all times me access to a large selection of books to
 learn on-the-go. (which makes the necessarily painful moments of
 waiting in line) Have no loyalty to location, corporation, or your
 past public statements. Be an absolute opportunist doing whatever is
 best for the future in the current situation, unbound by the
 past. Have loyalty for only your most important human
 relationships. Living requires optionality. You need the freedom to
 explore and some aimless wandering. 3. Make decisions as late as
 possible. Don’t make appointments except for the same day. Also,
 tell friends you’re coming an hour later than you plan on
 arriving. 4). Option blindness - when we obsess on trying to achieve
 X we become blind to better options that are not conducive to X. 5)
 Redundancy is having multiple ways of doing the same thing.
</p>

<p>
<b>What doing good looks like</b> 
</p>

<p>
Work should look like play.  Not competing. Standing out of all hierarchies. This
makes you a Category of one. Devote yourself to something. Enjoying
your work is the best way to become the best at what you do. Never
try to convince yourself to do something. If one reason doesn’t
suffice, then don’t do it. Don’t wobble. Never work with someone a
day that you wouldn’t spend a lifetime with. Never Try to Convince
Yourself. Working hard only recently became prideful instead of
shameful Hard work is a tool.
</p>

<p>
The cure for procrastination is
changing ones environment or your profession, where you don’t have
to fight your impulses. One should lead a life in which
procrastination is good. “Doing research on a topic” feels
profane. Why would you write about something you can’t remember?
That you wouldn’t use? Let Procrastination kill anything that I’m
putting off too long. Avoid things that don’t give you energy
Embracing nature &gt; fighting nature. Minimize dealing with things you
dislike 
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
Weekends shouldn’t exist. Time changes
  when you do.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Address problems while they are small, ignore good news. Identify
to them when they are small. Hard conversations get harder the
longer you wait to have them. Focus on picking the low hanging
fruit. When someone says they are stupid, they are more stupid
than he thinks.</li>

<li>Provide for the worst case, let the best case take care of itself:
Change a tire in the rain. Whenever I find myself using the phrase
“I have to,” instead  I say “I get to.”  What you own starts
owning you. Consider that Losing all your fortune is much less
painful than only losing half of it. Some people make the mistake
of thinking the worst thing is the worst thing you can think
of. It could always be worse.  When some adverse event takes
place, instead of wondering "why did it happen ?", ask "why wasn't
it worse ?.”  When you realize you are underestimating something,
it is likely you are still underestimating it. What did not happen
rather than what did happen</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Obvious Red FlagsThe most harmful source of Information is
advice advertised (for better or for worse) to help you. There
is an asymmetry between givers of “positiva,” (Do This)
prescriptive advice as they do not incur the harm you would
from following their advice.  Avoid commentary from anyone who
has to feed their family. Unsuccessful people give the most
advice.</li>

<li>Risk Sharing They still get paid even when you go bust. For
best results, just look at what they do, not what they tell you
to do. Another trick is to never trust the beautiful
philosopher.  To filter the credibility of advice, don’t take
advice from the poster child of their profession. If they don’t
play the role or speak the jargon, that means that their skill
speaks for them.</li>

<li>Luck and Randomness Another factor that makes advice hard to
translate is luck and randomness. Most communicated advice is
flawed: Even if the giver of the advice is innocuous, advice is
like handing you the numbers to their winning lottery ticket.</li>

<li>Advice to follow The advice you can trust, but is hard to
profit from and thus rarely given, is what to avoid. The ten
commandments are all acts of omission. Trust the advice of old
sources (your grandma and old books)</li>

We over Me    - The collective is more important than the
individual. We are more important than me. Not just the loss of your
life, but one that lies in a broader set of people, one that includes
a family, a community, a tribe, a fraternity. It is not possible to
be ethical and universalist. You are part of a specific group that is
larger than a narrow you but narrower than humanity in
general. Everyone exercises the silver rule. Remember what others
have done for you. And let the instinct of gratitude take over. Don’t
give crap don’t take crap. If it is good for the community, it is
good for me

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Eschew busyness, avoid entrapment</b></li>
<li>Work should look like play. Weekends shouldn’t exist. Time changes
when you do. Not competing.  Standing out of all hierarchies. This
makes you a Category of one. Devote yourself to
something. Enjoying your work is the best way to become the best
at what you do. Never try to convince yourself to do something. If
one reason doesn’t suffice, then don’t do it. Don’t wobble. Never
work with someone a day that you wouldn’t spend a lifetime
with. Never Try to Convince Yourself.  Working hard only recently
became prideful instead of shameful Hard work is a tool. The cure
for procrastination is changing ones environment or your
profession, where you don’t have to fight your impulses. One
should lead a life in which procrastination is good. “Doing
research on a topic” feels profane. Why would you write about
something you can’t remember?  That you wouldn’t use?  Let
Procrastination kill anything that I’m putting off too long. Avoid
things that don’t give you energy Embracing nature &gt; fighting
nature. Minimize dealing with things you dislike</li>

<li>Aesthetics and personal elegance. - one way to increase your
happiness is to make the place you live in beautiful. Ideally
doing most of it with your own hands. How you react to things. -
extreme ownership. Live with dignity  Do not play victim. Do not
complain. Decouple your self worth from — anything you don’t
control. The only thing you can control is how you react to
things. Everything is my fault. Dress your best.</li>
<li>schedules (separate from work as play) no clocks, no wristwatch,
no schedules. Forgetting what day of the week it is.</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>True equality</b></li>

<li>Peer Envy - Don’t do anything that makes you uncomfortable when
you look in the mirror. Better to neither envy nor be envied. You
have a real life if and only if you do not compete with anyone in
any of your pursuits Architects try to impress other artichetects,
academics try to impress other architects, True humility is when
you can surprise yourself more than others. Any action one takes
with the aim of winning an award, any award, corrupts to the
core. the greatest test is how you react when you are insulted in
front of a crowd Or when you get an email from a journalist. Don’t
become humble when you lose everything. We need someone to not
impress.  Care about the few who like it more than the multitude
who dislike it. Never say anything bad about anyone else.  Ignore
comments praise and criticism from people you wouldn’t hire. Don’t
signal wealth. Be the person you’d be when you’re alone 

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The squeeze you feel is them putting you into their box. Their
rules, their way, their game. There are no rules, no
boundaries. Play your game; not theirs.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>


<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Life is an adventure, not a competition. A good life isa
stoorre you’re proud of. There’s no score. Everyone is trying
to be the best, or top %1 percent  Few are trying to do what
they like regardless of what everyone else does.  Competition
is for chasing the preferences of others; playing someone
else’s game</li>
