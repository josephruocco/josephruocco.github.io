In *A la Recherche du temps perdu*, the novel by Marcel Proust, the
narrator tests the pleasures of modern living and learns that our
perceived upsides of these lifestyles don't match their realities. 

He tries to be an aristocrat, and after finding it dreadful, tries
pursues a lover, but also to no avail. These  situtaions he finds himself
made miserable, unfufilled, or just plain bored. 

The narrator finds fulfillemnt ultimately through art: not as a
painter or artist, but to view the world as an artist is by savouring the
world's simplistic elegance through a playful, childlike view. 

To not be a creature of habit, or to indulge in excess pleasures, for
they're even so short lasting.  

The Philosophy of Epicurus is  an antecednt to
Proust. Epicurus' happy life helps is about helpng us  manage our
desires.
