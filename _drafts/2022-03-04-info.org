#+TITLE: Information Overload 

Having so much information at our fingertips  wouldn't be so much of a
problem if it wasn't for our limited attention and mental capacity. 

Garbage begets garbage. Talk has become so cheap on the internet that
it's like a snake eating it's own tail. 

The problems of too much information: 
1) the paradox of choice- too many options makes choosing debilitating
2) "Tunneling" - focusing on smaller, inconsequential data, say, what
   shoes pedestratians are wearing while crossing the street, could
   make you miss the car that's driving down the lane. 

3) What a million people know itsn't worth knowing. 


So, the amount of information we consume regularly can reach a toxic
threshhold,- i.e. /we must be careful about how much we consume/

The important implication being, as well, that the ratio of
noise/signal skews  nonlinearly as the size of data increases.

Less is more. Focus on what's important.
