* The Skeptic 
** /Characteristics of Extreme Domains/ 
- /*The Impact of Rare Events*/ We exist in a world where some situations
  are dominated by the singular occurances of rare events. Consider
  that even if you cheat on your spouse only once in the duration of
  relationship, /you are not going to be in a relationship for much
  longer/ [fn:1]  

** /Knowledge Through Subtraction/  
- /The Power of Disconfirmation/ In life, disconfirmation is more rigorous
  than confirmation. One single piece of disconfirming evidence wipes
  out any prior confirming examples. Reasoning fails in extreme domains when we
  try to go from specific instances to categoricals. The importance of
  discon. is that it lengthens the gap in these instances between what
  you know and what you don't know. Which as a result a much, much higher
  premium on what you do not know. 

- /Hunting for Black Swans/ Half of the game is realizing that it is
  about what you don't know and what others know is more important
  than the reverse. Or what you dislike and others like (hence, your
  futuer self). Learning is admitting you were wrong. Acquire as many
  books as you can possibly own. Research more you disagree with than
  the reverse.  What a million people know isn't worth knowing. The
  news isn't worth watching. Fed to you via algorithm. Only consume
  information that you seek out. [fn:2] 

- /Negative Advice in Personal Life/ Knowledge becomes robust by
  necessarily knowing what is wrong and avoiding it. We get smarter by
  learning what not to do and by avoiding ignorance. We know what is
  wrong better than what is right. Avoid unhappiness than it is to
  pursue happiness. Avoiding ignorant people is easier than
  surrounding yourself with 'intelligent' ones. 

- /Life is Not A Story/ A consequence of seeing the world through
  your own mind is suffering from the mental distortion our memory of
  events and emotions through time all human beings do. We see the
  past through a narrative lens (most historical records, news,
  journalism, etc) and the future vicariously through another story
  (our plans, forecasts, etc). Life is such that the future will bring events we've
  never seen before and we look at the past as if we could've known it
  all along. A diary retells the past from the
  present prspective without retelling a narrative. Avoid planning,
  maximize /optionality/, (More on that later) 

* The Stoic 
** /How to Become Indestructable/
- /'Less Is More' Rationality/ - Rationality is survival of the worst
  case. Rationality is what you do to avoid ruin in the event of the
  worst case. Take steps for your business and life to take care of
  that and the rest takes care of itself. In the real world, the worst
  case is worse than anything you've seen before or could reasonably
  predict. We can use the following rules to increase robustness.
  1) To learn how to survive, learn to respect what has survived. If
     something has been true for a while, and it seems irratinoal, you
     have the wrong definition of rationality. 
  2) Redundancy & Applications. We can learn from Mother Nature -- the oldest and the
     wisest -- that aggressive redundancy can best prepare us for an
     unknowable future. 
     - Backups. As they say among military groups, 'Two is one and One
       is None.' Redundancy in the cash under the mattress is security
       against an unpredictable future. Expecting fragile objects to
       break in only a  matter of time is not only wise but realistic.
       Redundancy takes other forms too, like extra strength or
       capacity that makes having it more efficient than a
       preconceived 'optimal' route. 
     - Functional Redundancy. Meaning that multiple objects can
       perform the same function. Eyes can hear by reading lips. Smell
       enhances taste.  Your copy of /War And Peace/ can be used as a
       doorstop. Your Diploma of Graduation in Russian Comparative
       Literature can be used as a mousepad.
     - Decision Making. Redundancy can take the form of having
       multiple options. With uncertainty, the best decision at any
       time allows us to change course when new information
       surfaces. This means not letting goals or destinations make us
       blind to new and better options.  
       - Listening to Instincts (Procrastination & Forgetfulness) Make
         decisions as late as possible.
       - Less Is More -  Never Convince yourself to do something. If
         you have more than one reason, don't do it. Nobody says:
         "this man is a criminal, he killed 20 people, and he has bad
         breath." The more convincing you need the worse the  
         
         
  3) At the end of the day, you are the one to determine your risk
     level. Avoid taking so much risk that you lose sleep at night. 

** /Modernity & Domain Depedence/
- /Overcompensation/ Modernity seeks to deprive us of life's innate
  sense of variability and randomness. When forced to overcompensate
  we become better off when not under such conditions. 
  1) Human bones are strengthened through episodic stress. Falling
    asleep is easier with background noise. 
  2) Interpersonal relationships are well maintained when problems (and
    conversations) are had early. 
  3) Innovation and Discovery. Innovation happen through aggressive
    trial and by accident, discovering a product or use of a product
    never seen before. Increase your exposures and fail
    early and cleanly. Creativity is your number of trials.

- /Education/ Curriculums suffers from one-size-fits-all effect. On
  average the knowledge you learn in schools is of little copmetitve
  value. To reverse this effect, learn with the mind's natural
  senses of boredom and curiosity.
  1) /Learning With Emotions/ In Part 1, it was shown that Knowledge
     that is worth knowing is as far from the center as possilbe. What
     will take you there is through undirected trial-and-error.  
     - /Risk Makes Things Interesting/ Learn out of necessity. Learn
       to solve a problem or out of interest, never out of obligation.
       When we have something to lose, or risk failure, we become
       desparately to find out as much as we can about a subject. Much
       like the pilot of a plane is maximally paranoid or an addict's
       cunning comes from to procure drugs. 
     - /Avoiding Boredom/ If you get bored easily that means your
       /b***t/ detector is functioning properly. Evaluate curiosity
       daily, Read accordingly. Notice when you a book starts to bore
       you. As soon as that's the case, switch to another book. (This
       is where it is extremely helpful but not necessary to own a lot
       of books ) Don't read something that you need to speedread,
       don't watch a video that you have to watch at 2x, If you're not
       fully engaged or easily distracted, find a better way or don't
       do it. [fn:3] If schools wanted to resemble real life, they
       would only care about the subject in which the stduent has the
       highest grade and ignore the others, In a convex world, the
       average is of zero significance. 
       
 # Learning about subjects with skin in the game 
 # addiction to learning.  

  2) /Books & Real Friends/ Get to know books as you would friends,
     get to know them a little at a time. The test of whether you
     really liked a book is to reread it; the test of whether you
     really like someone’s. Company is if you are ready to meet him
     again and again. Friendship that ends never was one, any book
     not worth rereading isn’t worth reading. The number of books
     you finished reading through once this year has as much meaning
     as the number of people you met once and never saw again. Seek
     the ones that will stick around for a long time. 
   
  3) /Leisure is Fertile without Distraction/ The mind is most
     intelligent while devoted to effortless activity. When freed
     from constraints, work, schedules, the mind discoveries
     opportunities that it didn't see before. As anyone who might have
     taken a shower before would realize. Go for a walk without a
     phone, without listening to music. [fn:4] 

- /Diet and Exercise/ Diets & Exercise Regimens tax the body with
  chronic stressors. Gyms are sterilized environments that work one
  muscle at a time, making the part stronger at teh expense of the
  whole. Diets through modern constructions rely on strong willed
  moderation instead of randomized fasting and volume intake. To
  simulate natural exercise and dietary conditions, try Hiking on
  rocky trails with steep inclines. Deadlift your maxlift on a
  barbell. Never eat foods out of a box, and avoid modernized diet
  foods. Randomly skip meals, and work out when hungry. 

** /Acceptance of Fate/ 

- /Competition & Playing Your Own Game/ Everyone is trying to be the
  best, or top 1% percent. Few are trying to do what they like
  regardless of what everyone else does.  Competition is for chasing
  the preferences of others; playing someone else’s game. The squeeze
  you feel is them putting you into  their box. Their rules, their
  way, their game. There are no rules, no boundaries. Play your game;
  not theirs. You have a real life if and only if you do not compete
  with anyone in any of your pursuits. 

- /Killing Hope/ Try to kill anything called hope in you. You never
  want to put yourself in a sutiation where you wish very badly for
  something specific to happen to you, an event where tomorrow would
  suddenly make a big difference for the rest of your life. 
  - say, the outcome ofa job interview, a lawsuit, winning the lotto,
    meeting a significant other, getting a paper accepted, have gold
    rise, have your brother in law die in a car accident, or other
    events that can markedly chaneg your life. If this is the case for
    you are royally enslaved to circumstances. 
  - Take good events when they happen, but don't depend on them like a
    loser. 
  - ORganize yourself in a way to not have to dream for a better
    tomorrow or day after. 

- /Personal Dignity/ There is no such thing as failure, only death. Which is happening
  anyway. Do not play victim. Do not complain. Decouple your self
  worth from anything you don’t control.  

* The Epicurean 

** /Happiness/ 
  - /Happiness & Commiditization/  You can't buy happiness, so avoid
    people who are trying to sell it and avoid pursuing it. True
    happiness is restful sleep, frequent laughs, meals with friends,
    afternoon naps, good coffee, gratitude, and clear
    conscience. 
    - /Frequency of Pleasures/ The Things you like you also like at a given frequency. Junk
        food/junk inforamtion is enjoyed best when kept restrained to a
        weekly "cheat day" than moderately throughout. Think, Sleep is
        best enjoyed when tired, food when hungry, water when thirsty. To
        be grateful for something, deprive yourself of it.
    - /Injecting Randomness/ Life is better with surprises. The best days can be
      recovering a lost wallet or phone. Not being prisoner to a
      schedule ro calendar, an alarm clock or wristwatch. if luxury is
      not creating more and more varied options for life, you're doing
      it wrong. Don't run after trains. 
    - /Avoiding Busyness/ It's foolish to complain you don't have enough
      time. We shouldn't know when the week begins or ends. 

** /Friendship/  
- Don't reason with someone about something they didn't reason
  themselves into.

[fn:1] If you're in a relationship that tolerates infidelity, you
shouldn't be in that relationship.
[fn:2] The Information age equivalent of 'only eat what you kill.'
[fn:3] /A note on addiction, distraction, boredom, & laziness/ Not to be
misunderstood. Manufactured modern distractions feed our addictions to
novelty. /Pursuing these distractions is not avoiding boredom/
# Try weening yourself off of these and  at the start you may find that
# you get withdrawal pains. This is a separate issue entirely. (as you
# would say, with a heroin addict, not by /giving them more drugs/) are
# necessary to have. There is a difference between a "boring book" and
# you being easily distracted. If you are too easily bored, change your
# inputs. 
# - For a classic work, the burden of proof is on you 

[fn:4] Recently Meditation practices have become commonplace for
addictive 'self-improvement' type As. While it's literally doing
nothing, purpotedly that's still better than the information most
people consume.
