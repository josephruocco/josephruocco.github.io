#+TITLE: Trial & Error and Computational Irreducibility

The biggest changes to our quality of life came from tinkerers. 

Entrepreneurs, inventors, Designers and Artists, 

Whatever your Creative pursuits lead you, -- the biggest payoffs come
from being maximally experimental. 

 Aggressive Trial and Error leads to discovery. 

Creativity is your number of trials. 

Stephen Wolfram has this idea of computational irreducibility - which,
in this context, means /you don't know what doing each trial will take
you until you do it/ 

Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again. 

That's not the case with volatile domains. 

Human mind has a hard time understanding nonlinearities. - Water has a
certain boiling point, and so do we. 


How far are you willing to go?
