Most of the time our mental perceptions lead us to error,
our biological programming isn't wrong. 

It's okay to be wrong 99% of the time while being prudent. 

For example, when we misperceive a length of rope to be a snake, which
we do even if we\'re wrong 99% of the time, it\'s because snakes are
threats to our survival.

If having these insticts kept us alive, then who\'s care\'s if you\'re
wrong? Being right is less important than being dead, than these perceptions are hardly \"irrational.\"


Considering that although you may be right 99% of the time holding the
inverse belief, *to mistake a snake for a rope* one time has a
irreversible conesquenc.

This is the basis for which we should judge the rationality of our
actions, not for their truth value, but their survival value.

Life is a long game. Winning is judged by how long you can keep playing.
