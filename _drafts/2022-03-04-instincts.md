Most of the time our mental perpcetions lead us to error, but since
being right is less important than being dead, than these perceptions
are hardly \"irrational.\"

For example, when we misperceive a length of rope to be a snake, which
we do even if we\'re wrong 99% of the time, it\'s because snakes are
threats to our survival.

If having these insticts kept us alive, then who\'s care\'s if you\'re
wrong? I\'d rather be alive than.

Considering that although you may be right 99% of the time holding the
inverse belief, *to mistake a snake for a rope* one time has a
irreversible conesquenc.

This is the basis for which we should judge the rationality of our
actions, not for their truth value, but their survival value.

Life is a long game. Winning is judged by how long you can keep playing.
