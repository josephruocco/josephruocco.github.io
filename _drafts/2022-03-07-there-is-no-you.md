The central flaw with optimizing is that \"everything else\" ceases to
exist, and makes people think the individual, not the collective, is the
true unit.

The collective is more important than the individual. We are more
important than me.

Not just the loss of your life, but one that lies in a broader set of
people, one that includes a family, a community, a tribe, a fraternity.
