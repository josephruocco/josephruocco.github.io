#+TITLE: Happiness Can't Be Bought


Happiness can't be bought, so ignore those who are selling it and stop
pursuing it as a /thing I can buy/

That's because external circumstances- events outside of
ourselves- promise us happiness, and this is satisfying, that is,
until we get it. Once you get it, you stop wanting it. 

And new desires come to take its place. We trick ourselves while
chasing that comparison moment. 

Expectation leads to disappointment. 

Dependency on luxury turns into snobbery. But you do become slightly more
perturbed. You start complaining about tepid coffee, or poor
service. You become a bad tipper. Petty tyrany.

True happiness is restful sleep, frequent laughs, meals with friends,
afternoon naps, good coffee, gratitude, and a clear conscience.

if luxury is not creating more and more varied
options for life, you're doing it wrong. 

Rehearsed conversations, rehearsed laughs.  

Having Enough - knowing when enough is enough
