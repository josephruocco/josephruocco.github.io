Something poorly understood about skeptical philosophers (Hume, Sextus
Empiricus, Huet, Montaigne, Pyrrho & the Pyrrhonian skeptics) is that
their skepticism tends to be directed at contemporary experts, rather
than traditions, which they tend to follow as a default strategy. And
the crowds against which they stand up are the crowds of \"experts\", or
the masses infatuated with \"expert\" driven ideas.

Most people don\'t understand what it means to be s1keptical of experts.
Skepticism should be one-sided, or should lead to one-sided actions, the
one that is \"wise\" in the precautionary sense. If the majority of
experts tell you water is poisonous, don\'t exercise your skepticism by
drinking. But if experts tell you water is \"safe\", you are invited to
be skeptic, or err on the side of skepticism.

Not all theories or beliefs are equally valuable.

Ideas are selected on how well they help us survive.

The judge of how well they help us survive is time.

As time goes on, the longer an idea is exposed to the trial of
falsification. It is only a matter of time before someone with fatal
belief exits the gene pool.

The longer an idea has been around, the longer it will be around.

Read old books.

If an idea that you deem \"irrational\" has been around for a long time,
then you have the wrong definition of ratinoality.

Mother Natrue does not make mistakes. Old books are not mistaken
