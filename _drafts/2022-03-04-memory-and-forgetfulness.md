title: Memory & Forgetfulness
---

To be forgetful is to have a functioning mind.

Everytime we remember, we revise what we remember.

We can\'t possibly remember exactly

We can\'t unthink or unexperience a thought or an event once it\'s
happened.

And that cerates a cognitive distortion.

Looking backwards fools us into thinking the future was knowable all
along.

And makes us forget how we were thinking and feeling when the future was
still unknown.
