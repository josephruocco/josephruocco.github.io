How do we prepare for the worst, given that we don\'t know what the next
worst is?

Consider that your reading this with two eyes. Or That many of the parts
of your body compensates for its fraility by suppling you with *a
backup* is no mistake by Mother nature.

Overspecialization and optimization are frail to the unknown. Limiting
single points of failure. Like depending on a single supplier, a single
employee, or a single product to complete a task.

Stockpiling is aggressively efficient. Having physical and functional
redundancies keeps you alive. Having multiple options is freedom.
