Title: "Thoughts on coming up with ideas"
---

* Where do Ideas come from? 
- the Proustian moment, when 
- flow, when the boredom stimulating environment


* rules for creating ideas
- 10 ideas everyday, original, or at least one's you've never thought of. 
- if the idea is not rejected outright, you're not risking enough
    - 
- confusion is the where epiphanies happen -
    experience confusion daily.
- experimentation - find the first step to take. 
- write them down
- share ideas,- Google, ideas are not commodities -
  dont keep ideas to yourself
    verify them 
- corollary (steal ideas, which <i>Steal Like an Artist</i> has some insight).
- corollary #2, reading/learning exploring your interests. consume your interests. 
- routines: for learning good tools (creating code or content.) - everything eventually becomes a status signaling game. be careful. 
- you exist to be creative.
your creative existence depends on " if and only if you are [create] things without a visible objective, with no justification and, above all, outside the dictatorship of someone elseâ€™s narrative." (Procrustes)
