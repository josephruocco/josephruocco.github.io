burnout is just a realistic expectation

Why Burnout Is Bad?
- we cant get work done
- why? because we focus on inconsequential stuff?
- why? because our brain can't actively assess high level thinking
- why? because it's stressed to the max and it needs to shut off
- why? because it used too much will to create something from nothing without any reward

How We Get Burned Out 
If you've ever burned out before, you know what that feels like. You spin your wheels and nothing seems to budge. You feel lost and like everything you've done and are doing is inconsequential

That's not true.

Burnout is a symptom of having a goal... and using your willpower to the max.

# Understanding Interest & Energy

Interest & Energy are cyclical. If you aren't rewarding yourself everyday, you're going to hit a wall eventually, even if you have a will of steel. Because people who think they have the most willpower are most likely to give into temptations. And giving into manafactured promises of temptation will break you because you aren't actually meeting your needs.
