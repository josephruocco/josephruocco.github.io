<p>
THere is an old problem of skepticism in the tradition of Hume,
Algazel and Sextus Empiricus. This is the "The Turkey Problem": a
turkey knows its been fed consistently everyday for the last three
months. How much will the Turkey be fed after THanskgiving? Past data
mistakes the possibility of an unobserved future event. Prediction is
for turkeys. 
</p>

<p>
Forecasters, speculators and economists sometimes have as much
knowledge about the future as fortune teller. At times, all the
knowledge we know about the past can't tell us everything about the
future. And there are unanticiptaed unknowable events in the future
which, by ignoring them, we make ourselves susceptible to ruinous
harm. We miss the big things.

<p>
Who does Advice really help?
Beware  advice. There are hidden pitfalls underneath this kind of
information that makes the one who presents advice <i>positiva</i> could
give harm to the one who receives it without recourse. 
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>Underestimating Luck and Randomness</b> -  Another factor that makes
advice hard to translate is luck and randomness. Most communicated
advice is flawed: Even if the giver of the advice is innocuous,
advice is like handing you the numbers to their winning lottery
ticket.</li>

<li><b>Uneven payoffs</b> - still get paid even when you go bust. For best
results, just look at what they do, not what they tell you to
do. Another trick is to never trust the beautiful philosopher.  To
filter the credibility of advice, don’t take advice from the poster
child of their profession. If they don’t play the role or speak the
jargon, that means that their skill speaks for them.  There is an
asymmetry between givers of “positiva,” (Do This) prescriptive
advice as they do not incur the harm you would from following their
advice.  Avoid commentary from anyone who has to feed their
family. Unsuccessful people give the most advice.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h4 id="orgbd584a3">What We Know Best</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgbd584a3">
<p>
To build a durable base of information, the following will tell you
with what probability will the inforamtion be true: 
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>Age</b> - Informatino that has been around a long time will likely
be around for a lot longer than the new thing. Prune "news"
sources-  TV, radio, social media, etc. Trendy information is
fragile information. Stick to old books. # 24. Trust the advice of
old sources (your grandma and old books)</li>
</ol>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>Distribution</b> -  what a million people know is not worth
knowing. If you know what everyone else knows, your payoff will be
average.  Acquire as  many books as you can possibly own. What you
don't know (and no one else knows) is far more important than
what you do. There is no upper limit to what you don't know.</li>

<h4 id="org4496c36">The Problem of Positive Knowledge</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org4496c36">
<p>
Discomfirmation is more rigorous than confirmation. 
Knowledge increases as we remove false, speculative
information.
</p>

<p>
At a personal level, We know what we disklike more than what we
like. You are much more likely to improve your life by removing what
you dislike rather than what you think you like. Avoidance of ignorant
people is like being around smart ones. The advice you can trust, but
is hard to profit from and thus rarely given, is what to avoid. The
ten commandments are all acts of omission.

<div id="outline-container-org03a4181" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org03a4181">Love Mistakes (While they are small)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org03a4181">
<p>
Ignore good news. Identify  to them when they are small. Hard
conversations get harder the longer you wait to have them. Focus on
picking the low hanging fruit. When someone says they are stupid,
they are more stupid than he thinks. 
</p>

<p>
Small mistakes are bounties of information. The more places you don't
know where to look, the better you are at finding where to look.

The Gym cripples us Artificially constructed
environments for the body and mind deprive us of the variablitiy
experienced in real life. This is caled Domain Dependence, and it
cripples us.  Martial arts combat doesn’t train you to a surprise
knife or glock in a street fight. A man checking into a hotel asks the
concierge to take your bags upstairs. Fifteen minutes later, the same
man goes to lift free weights in the hotel gym, replicating with
kettlebells natural exercises as if he were swinging a
suitcase. Skills that transfer: Street fights, off path hiking,
seduction, broad erudition.

<p>
Random Eposidic stress followed by ample recovery time. In teh form
of  1) Food Restrictions &amp; Volume Variance The food pyramid has been
flipped for the last fifty years. It is easier to fast than to diet. Eat real foods you enjoy, to
prevent you from eating crap. Eat nothing out of the box. No sugar,
bread, or pasta. Avoid artificial sweeteners. No sweet fruits. Eat
very very large meals on occasion, like Sunday Feasts, while other
times skipping meals. 2) Exercise &amp; Sleep - Do No Moderate Exercise
sessions, either too little or way too much, with no set
schedule. Take Very, very long walks with Occasional sprints. Do No
purely aerobic exercise. Experience variance in body Temperature. Let
yourself become thirsty occasionally. Occasionally sleep deprived, but
default sleep with no alarm clock. In the wild, exercise just
happened. Reward comes after exercise not before, Occasional
abundance. More examples: Childhood immunity is strengthened by
playing in the dirt, Episodic stress to your bones makes them
stronger, Sleeping in absolute silence is difficult. Focus and attention is
sharpened by café chatter or when the speaker whispers. Workout when
you’re hungry. Invers: Avoid sitting all day. An hour in the gym won’t
reverse the effects of 8 hours a day in a chair. Lounge or stand,
never sit. I’d expect a person with a sedentary lifestyle to have at

<h4 id="org1333292">Learning &amp; Decision Making with Emotions</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org1333292">
<p>
Emotions are biological signals. They can be used to aid us in
decision making and learning 1) <b>Procrastination</b> Always make decisions at the last minute. Because the longer you wait
the smarter you become. Decisions are best made when the most present
information is available. 2) <b>Boredom</b> - Humans don’t like to do
boring things. The purpose of life should be avoiding boredom, or
using boredom as a biological clock,without being impolite If you get
bored easily, your B***t detector is functioning
properly. Beaureaucrats and executives are best at sitting through
boring meetings and keeping attention on boring tasks. Laziness
is enduring an existence you don’t like and never trying to do anything
about it. You don't get a second chance at life if you knowingly
endure boring things. 3) <b>Forgetfulness</b>- If you forget (some) things,
it means that our mind knows how to filter 4) <b>Uncertainty</b> - The minds
desires certainty while also craving the delicate chance of
surprise. The best days are finding a lost wallet or laptop. You can’t
feel alive and certain at the same time. Having a set schedule and
predictable day makes me feel a little dead. We need to feel a little
bit lost, physically or mentally at least once a day. 5) <b>Curiosity</b> —
Read what you like until you like to read. The internet is widening
the gap between the curious and the non curious. Evaluate your
curiosity daily, read accordingly. As soon as a book starts to bore
you, switch. There’s  a perfect book for you waiting to be read. By
keeping score of finished books, you won’t find it. Reading is a
journey to find the best books for you. 6) <b>urgency &amp;
distractedness</b> - Deep Learning is never Quickly learned - Trade
speedfor depth-peeding and cramming means you aren’t curious. Trade
speed for depth. If you find yourself doing things that require a
podcast, you should ask yourself whether there’s a better way of doing
it. Rushing is short term thinking. Don’t hurry, don’t stop. An
Internet Sabbath cannot by itself cure a distracted brain.  Instead of
scheduling the occasional break from distraction so you can focus, you
should instead schedule the occasional break from focus to give in to
distraction. 
</p>

<p>
Never convince yourself to do something. If one reason doesn’t
suffice, then don’t do it. Never work with someone a day that you
wouldn’t spend a lifetime with. Never Try to Convince Yourself. 
</p>

<p>
The cure for procrastination is changing ones environment or your
profession, where you don’t have to fight your impulses. One should
lead a life in which procrastination is good. “Doing research on a
topic” feels profane. Why would you write about something you can’t
remember? That you wouldn’t use? Let Procrastination kill anything
that I’m putting off too long. Avoid things that don’t give you energy

How the mind gets unstuck intelligent when you don’t instruct it what to do. 
Work should look like play. Weekends shouldn’t
exist. Time changes when you do. Not competing.  Standing out of all
hierarchies. schedules (separate from work as play) no clocks, no wristwatch,
no schedules. Forgetting what day of the week it is.
This makes you a Category of one. Devote yourself to
something. Enjoying your work is the best way to become the best at
what you do.  Never work with someone a day that you wouldn’t spend a
lifetime with. Never Try to Convince Yourself. Working hard only
recently became prideful instead of shameful Hard work is a tool. The

Problems will never solved by sitting at a desk. Idle
fascination, letting problems take a back burner that will surface in
the front of your mind when you’re focusing on your problem head
on.Go for a walk without your phone.  A walk is never a waste of
time.  -Walking and sleeping are all mysteriously necessary to have a
healthy life.- Shower, exercise, listening to music.  walk,  swim, or
Dance, Enjoy being a passenger in a car or bus. Ride a bike,  Draw or
paint, Take a bath or shower, Listen to music, especially without
words, Play songs you know well on a musical instrument, Meditate or
pray, or take a nap. By setting oneself totally free of constraints,
free of thoughts, free of this debilitating activity called work, free
of offers, then mysteries that you never thought existed emerge in
front of your eyes. Recognizing a new opportunity requires plenty of
idle time, wandering about, tinkering, trial and error, long walks,
randomized attention. And other inefficiencies of that sort. First
step is recognizing the opportunity. Second step is pouncing on the
good ones. Can’t do any of those things if you squeeze all the idle
time out of life. If you don’t know what your problem is, you need to
sleep. Dreaming is When the conductor falls asleep the orchestra
starts playing on its own accord.

managing it  does. What is fragile  has more to lose than to gain
Avoid risk of  ruin While dealing with  uncertainty, the worst class
of risk which  you should never tolerate  is those which make you “go
bust,” that  is,which cause irreversible  injury or death, financial
ruin,  betrayal of trust, etc.  In cases  where you are most fragile,
do  whatever it takes to prevent  blows up  from happening. Risk

learning online. It’s works, not words, that  make you earn your

<p>
Creativity is your list of trials. Aggresive
trial and error in domains where randomness rules can help us find 
Options laughing in our faces. Exercise rationality by not
looking in the Same place twice. Presents small errors as
information and large gains which we can exploit when they
arise. If you’re ideas aren’t being rejected outright, you’re not taking
enough risk Being confused is important, or you’re not taking
advantage of the idea space. Confusion is the edge of a
breakthrough. Let it marinate + bother the back of your mind until
the root cause is discovered. A novel root cause implies a new
idea. Come up with 20 ideas. The way to come up with 1 good business
is to create 10 business.s. Trial and error is freedom. You can’t
fail you can only die - which is happening anyway Why should I listen
to you if you put nothing at risk? There is no "failure" for a
risk-taker*

Provide for the worst case, let the best case take care of itself:
Change a tire in the rain. Whenever I find myself using the phrase
“I have to,” instead  I say “I get to.”  What you own starts owning
you. Consider that Losing all your fortune is much less painful than
only losing half of it. Some people make the mistake of thinking the
worst thing is the worst thing you can think of. It could always be
worse.  When some adverse event takes place, instead of wondering
"why did it happen ?", ask "why wasn't it worse ?.”  When you realize
you are underestimating something, it is likely you are still
underestimating it. What did not happen rather than what did happen.
