Happiness can\'t be bought, so ignore those who are selling it and stop
pursuing it as a *thing I can buy*

That\'s because external circumstances- events outside of ourselves-
promise us happiness, and this is satisfying, that is, until we get it.
Once you get it, you stop wanting it.

And new desires come to take its place. We trick ourselves while chasing
that comparison moment. Most people are racing to a place they don\'t
want to be.

Expectation leads to disappointment.

Dependency on luxury turns into snobbery. But you do become slightly
more perturbed. You start complaining about tepid coffee, or poor
service. You become a bad tipper. Petty tyrany.

True happiness is restful sleep, frequent laughs, meals with friends,
afternoon naps, good coffee, gratitude, and a clear conscience.

There seems to be no upper bound to how much money we could have, but we
keep pursuing it, as if to punish ourselves.

You don\'t want so little money that you\'re losing sleep at night, but
not so much either that\'d you\'d lose sleep at night.

if luxury is not creating more and more varied options for life, you\'re
doing it wrong.

Rehearsed conversations, rehearsed laughs.

Having Enough - knowing when enough is enough

Life should be to increase the things you would do for free and never do
for money
