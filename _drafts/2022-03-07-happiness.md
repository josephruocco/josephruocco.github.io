-   Playing your own Game

Everyone is trying to be the best, or top 1% percent. Few are trying to
do what they like regardless of what everyone else does. Competition is
for chasing the preferences of others; playing someone else's game.
Their rules, their way, their game. There are no rules, no boundaries.
Play your game; not theirs. You have a real life if and only if you do
not compete with anyone in any of your pursuits.

As with the Sour Grapes from Aesop's fable, fate can hold the grapes out
of reach, but we get to decide whether or not they are sour. Rejecting
the grapes outright is in itself its own more rewarding. It is hard to
lose at your own game.

Stop doing somethign when it becoems effortful.
