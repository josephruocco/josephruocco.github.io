#+TITLE:  Set Fate on Fire 

Fire loves obstacles. 


Say good to everything. 


/Personal Dignity/ A moment about Saying f**k you to fate. Should
    fate turn against you, do not play victim. Do not complain. Be
    worthy. As with the Sour Grapes from Aesopâ€™s fable, fate can hold
    the grapes out of reach, but we get to decide whether or not they
    are sour. Rejecting the grapes outright is in itself its own more
    rewarding. It is hard to lose at your own game. 

don't change the rules just because they odds are against you. 

this is no failure, only death. which is happening anyway.
