Peace for the stoics was something earned.

Not a vacant equanimty you get from a nihilism.

Stoics pursued much more active lifestyles than the buddha.

Stoic peace is knowing at the end of the day you've exercised every inch of
control over your situation as possible.

It's getting everything you can out of everything you've got.

Knowing you've controlled everything in your purview...

Not a stone unturned.

You don't Look up to the sky and just cross your fingers.

You have your nose to the ground.

Taking action.

And Inevitably

Peace.
