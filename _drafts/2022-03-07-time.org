#+TITLE: Time 

 It's foolish to complain you
       don't have enough time. We shouldn't know when the week begins
       or ends. Not being prisoner to a schedule ro calendar, an alarm clock or
       wristwatch. Rehearsed conversations, rehearsed laughs.  if
       luxury is not creating more and more varied options for life,
       you're doing it wrong.
