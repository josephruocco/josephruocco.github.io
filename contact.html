	    <p>Now let me share with you the core life-changing method I have used to base the principles of self improvement in any advice I've even given.</p>
<p>Based off the proven research on Habit development and neuroscience, I've come up with a way for anyone to create significant changes in their lives by using five core fundamentals about habits. </p>
	   <p>Remembering these 5 principles will give you the power to STRIDE towards any life improvement you wish to make.</p>
	  <h3>Good Habits Are...</h3>
	    <ul class="stride">
            <li>
             <b> Small</b>: Focus on one easy, tiny action. Do less than you can. </li>
              <li> <b> Triggerable:</b> No thinking required to start. Doing it every day is natural and easy.</li>
              <li>
               <b> Rewarding</b>: It's competitive, or it's something you fight to keep.</li>
              <li>
               <b> Irreversible</b>: You get rid of old ways. Change your environment so you have to accept the new behavior.</li>
              <li>
              <b> Daily</b>: You do it everyday.</li>
              <li>
               <b> Effective</b>: You can measure your progress, and you can improve with mentors.</li>
            </ul>

<p>Everyday I write about some STRIDE habits you can start easily. Make sure you read some and take action today!</p>
