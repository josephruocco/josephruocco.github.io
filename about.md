                <h1>Hi, I'm Joe.</h1>
              <p>To Live life with conviction</p>
<p>That's the point.</p>
<p>When I was first developing my healthy habits, every day I would look at myself in the mirror and say, "Can I be convicted of being a healthy person?"

</p>
<p>I do the same with my work, my family, my relationships, and on and on.</p><p>So then you might ask, how do I do?</p>
<p>That is, how do you commit to doing the actions everyday that make you the person you want to be?</p>
<p>That's where I can help.</p>

<p>
The purpose of this website is simple: how do I, Joe Ruocco, do the things I want to do, and how do I do them in a way that doesnâ€™t require any extra time or effort on my part other than a 5% change in my routine.
