# Hi, I'm Joe 
To Live life with conviction

That's the point.

When I was first developing my healthy habits, every day I would look at myself in the mirror and say, "Can I be convicted of being a healthy person?"

I do the same with my work, my family, my relationships, and on and on.

So then you might ask, how do I do?

That is, how do you commit to doing the actions everyday that make you the person you want to be?

That's where I can help.

The purpose of this website is simple: how do I, Joe Ruocco, do the things I want to do, and how do I do them in a way that doesn’t require any extra time or effort on my part other than a 5% change in my routine. 

## A Little About Me

Some fun facts about the setup of this project include:

* Born in Brooklyn. Still here.
* I picked up piano and guitar at age 7. My teacher (my aunt) gave me my first taste of deliberate practice. I was also doing Cub Scouts & Boy Scouts.
* When I was in the seventh grade I started skipping recess to go to the computer lab. I started to learn C++ via NewBoston.
* 2010: Started working. Made $10 an hour in a kitchen.
* I took Barbara Oakley’s Learning How To Learn (Highly Recommended). Discovered Massive Online Open Courseware, (MOOCS). Itunes U, Udacity, Coursera.
* I think I was like 14, I decided I wanted to be a musician. That didn't pan out. Found my way into Self-Help. Started reading Austin Kleon, Ryan Holiday, et al.
* 2016: Ignored all of my school reading to read books I was actually interested in. Bought books, then food and clothes. Decided to shift my life a bit. Took a Coursera Certification course in Java (Duke University)
* 2017: Started waking up at 5am to take MOOCS with school and weight lifting. Taught myself web development and made a prototype version of this site is PHP.
* Become an Eagle Scout. Grokked an scholarship for Computer Science. Started College
* Finishing up my degree. Working on Writing & this website.

# What I've learned in short

1. That if you think you can change, you can change
2. The Huge Research behind Deliberate Practice
3. To use Systems (Habits, Routines) over Goals for the Long Time.
4. To stack my life with as many easy, little 1% changes that I can to create massive change.

To simplify everything I learned, I thought up this simple acronym: S.T.R.I.D.E to help anyone learn and remember how to build life changing habits.

STRIDE basically is six adjectives that describe strong habits, and give you a framework to make habits of your own.

* Small: Keep what you're trying to do easy. It shouldn't take (at first) more than 5 minutes a day to do.:
* Triggerable: You established beforehand what time and place and things you need to do your practice. You've made all these things visible and obvious.
* Rewarding: You gift yourself a tiny reward- a break, a piece of candy, etc- for doing your habit. Or you pair the habit that you're trying to do with a habit that you find rewarding (watching TV while exercising)
* Irreversible: It's hard to do your habit, and it's hard to fall back into old ways. e.g. You clean out your fridge of bad foods, or you make a bet with your friends to commit to exercising.
* Daily: This is the most important feature. Consistency. Even if you do the smallest possible bit of what you're trying to do, you're reaffirming that you identify with this new behavior
* Effective: You keep searching for ways to improve. You find mentors, You measure your current activity and compare yourself to your past self.


# What I'm working on...

80% of my time I am working on this site. Please feel free to click around, use my method, grab some free content, or sign up for my newsletter.

I also (20%) work on coding projects. They are more for my own entertainment, so I may or may not put them out there.

In the last few years I've been enraptured by learning the tools of the trade.

If you're interested in learning how to program, here are some things I highly recommend you look into learning:

* Emacs: an open source, highly configurable text editor
* Ubuntu Linux: an open source, (user friendly?) operating system
* Jekyll: a static website engine that I built this site on.
* Github: a "social network" of sorts for programmers
