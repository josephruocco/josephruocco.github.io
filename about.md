# So
- Computer Science is the spark of my curiosity. I am fascinated by power and freedom of programming.

- Growing up, there were summer mornings in which I would wake up early to use th   computers at my local library. I saved up enough money so my parents would let    me buy a thing called a "router." A couple years later, when I was 7 years old	 I l arned about making websites and what people all across the world were making  on the internet. I figured I could do something with really useful with programm  ing.

-   To my dismay, the first couple of websites I learned how to make
    weren't quite that magical. But my curiosity of how this technology
    works didn't fade. There was so much more to know about technology-
    How do computers run several processes? How do networks work? How
    are computers made more efficient? How can I write more code to make
    software that people can use this information?

-   This interest led me into studying computer science. I am exploring
    the fintech sector to leverage the power of computing in the world
    of finance to create secure and efficient experiences for all users.
