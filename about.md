# Some Other things about me
- <b>I'm quiet:</b> Unless I'm not. I'm very conversational one-on-one, but I don't fare well with crowds for more than 2-3 hours. 
- <b>I'm future focused:</b> The best time to invest was yesterday. I focus on doing things for their future consequences. 
- <b>I take notes:</b> I'm putting a lot of my thoughts and knowledge here, and into ebooks. 
- <b>I'm deliberate:</b> The best replies I have to people's questions come days or weeks later. I don't post on social media. 
- <b>My 3 closest friends live miles away from me:</b> We skype every week. One's in Rhode island, the other in Michigan, the third in Turin.
