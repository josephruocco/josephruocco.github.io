Here They Are:

1. Hardness = size of problem / time 

Explanation: the difficulty of a problem has to do with two things...generally... the complexity or the size, and the amount of time given to solve it. Without any time, doing anything meaningfully hard is really difficult. With excessively complex problems that are in equal proportion to the amount of time given, (like exercising, eating healthy,) we tend to have a procrastinator's mind with dealing with these issues. 

2. Consistency = 1/ # of steps 

Explanation: simplification is the best way to ensure consistency. The more tedius steps involved, the more your willpower is taxed in order to solve them. Best to make habitual as many essential steps as we can, and save the killer critical details for a reliable checklist. 

3. Success = time(connections + intellect)

Explanation: Zero time, zero success. The network you build combined with your individual intellect is only multiplied by the number of time 

4. Breakthrough = Breakdown - Loss Of Self

5. ??Happiness = (Total Health)/money ??
