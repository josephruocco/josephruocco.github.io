Meditation is an abstract term. We’ll talk about that in a few. Pain isn’t too abstract.

One time a guy I knew split his pants open while trying to skate down a steep hill. Fullspeed. He didn’t break. But he stopped. It was a bloody mess. And all below the waist. (Eek!)
Another woman I know had twins. The anesthetic the doctor gave her didn’t kick in. She felt the whole thing.

I haven’t had twins without numbing drugs or ripped my pants open while skateboarding. But I’ve been in pain. A lot of pain. It’s because I’m stupid. Stupidity is painful. And stress, anxiety, worry, over-thinking -- makes you stupid.


Stress -> stupidity -> pain

So meditation is the way to fix pain. But How? Or Why? Because meditation is a skill. It’s something you practice. You can do a few different things. You ground yourself in the present. You do nothing. You detach yourself from your thoughts.

Doing these things are supposedly de-stressing.

Less stress, less pain.

But on the surface this was still really confusing to me. Because there’s a lot of offerings, and hard to tell which one is the right one.

So I did a lot of research. I’ve been all around different meditation methods. Headspace. Calm. Ziva. TM.org, Eckhart Tolle, Sam Harris, etc. There’s mindfulness, vipassana, transcendental, etc, etc, etc….

Basically, Meditation means different things to different people.

To me, I want meditation to fix my pain. Over-thinking causes me pain. So whenever i meditate, I take one of the huge worries I’m having for the day and I go through this process, which I’ve named B.U.D.D.H.A. to help me remember. (FYI The Buddha was the founder of Buddhism and instrumental in spreading the practice of meditation)

Every morning before I do anything else I go through these steps:

Breathe. Focus on the breath and only on the breath.
Unite the senses. While breathing, take each of the senses- touch, sight, smell, sound, and taste- and focus on them one at a time. Then in the next moment, feel them all at once. You are alive and you can do this.
Distance the problem. Now for the mental stuff. I look at my huge problem. Its parts are zooming past me at full speed. Let go of the thoughts. Let them happen. And take a step back. Just watch each thought and accept that they are happening.
Diffuse. Now as the thoughts are zooming past, see them one at a time. Let the distance grow between them. Like cars on a highway. Focus on how this one big problem is actually several small problems.
Heal. Pick one problem and focus on it. Distance and diffuse the problem into smaller subproblems. Find the one or two things you can do today.
Appreciate. Take a moment to be thankful that you have today to tackle this problem. Gratitude negates fear. Negates stress. Negates pain.
And then I start my day.

I ultimately tried combining all the good things of different meditation (Mindfulness, Mental Decluttering, Gratitude) into one practice for myself. Remember Meditation is a skill.

The benefits only come with serious practice.

As someone who spends a lot of time trying to tackle big problems, I realized the best thing I could do would be to make the time to practice everyday. The easiest way to do that is to build a habit around meditating that fits into my routine.

The way I build strong habits is by using another easy and proven technique I developed called S.T.R.I.D.E. (I like using acronyms.)

This one helps guarantee that you stick to your habits by making sure they are small, triggerable, rewarding, irreversible, daily, and effective.

Small habits are tiny, and easy. So do the smallest version of meditating possible. Try doing one or two of the steps of B.U.D.D.H.A. Don’t push yourself.

Triggerable means there is a cue for you to do them. You set a time and place to do them. For me, my meditation happens right when I wake up, in the big armchair in my living room.

Rewarding means you give yourself a little treat for doing something hard. After my meditation I drink a boiling cup of coffee, and eat a handful of almonds and a square of 70% dark chocolate. It is delicious.

Irreversible means you contract yourself to doing your practice everyday. The easiest way for meditating is to have a buddy. Together you can discuss how your practice is going and keep each other accountable.

Daily means you do your practice 7 days a week. If you have a busy morning, make the effort to save some time after lunch to do meditation. Remember that you can keep it small, so no excuses.

Effective means you have to keep looking for ways to make your practice better. Keep time on how much you meditate everyday. Seek mentors in the form of books or videos on how to be your best.

The pain goes away over time. Make sure to practice.

Keep asking questions. Keep learning.
