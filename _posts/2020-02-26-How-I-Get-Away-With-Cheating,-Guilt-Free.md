Title: How I Get Away With Cheating, Guilt-Free

<div class="message">Don't Actually Cheat. Use STRIDE, or another system which allows for the normal momentary 
hiccups of achievement</div>

We cheat. And we don't want to be cheated. We want much, much more for ourselves. 
The "normal" way to get more is to try for more. And when it's not enough, try harder. Push yourself regularly. 
Else you're cheating yourself. 

But the truth is, our best try gets us no more than superficial achievements. We have to be something
The happyness fades and then we go back to desiring more. 

That's because what we want is hardly what we need. The path to happiness isn't in wanting happiness itself, it's just filling 
basic needs on a consistent basis, and not asking for more. Happiness is the side effect. 

Using desires to be "happier" is fighting a hydra —  every one you think of grows two more. 
And unsurprisingly, mind finds the shortest, most satisfying desires to get met first.

And if you do this long enough, you might not have enough willpower to handle the damages. People like me who are 
trying to behave very disciplined can (also like me) break those commitments with embarassing regularity. 

We get stuck into bad habits that prevent us from becoming the much-better, happier versions of ourselves that we want to be.

But we have to turn knowledge into action, and take measures to outwit our future selves from preventing improvement.

### We all know what's right. That's not enough to just start doing more of it

You can expect to be bombarded with the desire to 
do anything but work deeply throughout the day, unless, that is, you’re smart about your habits.

Hitting your STRIDE with the STRIDE Habits method is about turning the nice-to-have needs that 
we should fill everyday into a must-have. 
It’s about how to take the necessary steps that help you fill your needs as a human being. 
The process I took involved asking myself a lot of questions about my mental and emotional 
loops and the larger “rules” that guided the different mental frameworks that I enabled myself with.

### STRIDE creates discipline without actually trying harder. 

It's worked so effectively it's ought to be considered cheating. Well, some of it is cheating. 

Over several years, I've crafted rules for myself allow the bending of rules as much as possible-- 
to such an extent that it may seem like cheating. 
But this is a skill I learned how to do, and so can you. These “rules” are better questions and steps.

I've tried trying harder. If you’ve repeatedly tried or committed to do something it hasn’t worked, I'm telling you you don't have to do that anymore. 

My favorite and most powerful ruleset is STRIDE (Small, Triggerable, Rewarding, Irreversible, Daily, Effective)
Replace short term goals with persistant, continuous improvement. 
The former  is a binary pass/fail with no consolation prize, while the latter has a potent snowball effect.

1. S: Make it small enough to be achievable.
2. T: Put good habits in the palm of your hands; discard distractions relentlessly. 
3. R: Make doing it enjoyable, with simple, sweet treats. 
4. I: Make not doing it painful.
5. D: Do it everyday.
6. E: Measure your progress, seek mentors. 

There are no real rules, so make rules that work for you.
