From *The Power Bible* by Brendon Lemon and William Beteet III

This book is full of actionable advice. This is one takeaway I got from reading it today. 
This is powerful. Good books need to be read slowly, over and over again. 
And it makes me think of the quote attributed to Bruce Lee, 

> I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, 
> but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.
