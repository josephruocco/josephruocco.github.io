Incentives
1. Beware of the advice that someone gives you; just copy what they actually do.
2. Anything labeled "organic" or "free range", unless explicitly stated 100% ____, then will still probably be about an unhealthy as the inorganic option.


Learning 
1. Prune the daily consumption of these “news” sources from your life: magazines, podcasts, TV, newspapers, web surfing.
2. Learn subjects you're naturally curious about. School should be like a driving test - you just need to pass. Getting a "A" is like trying to be the "best" driver.
3.As soon as a book starts to bore you, switch.
4. Read old books.
5. Acquire as many books as you can possible own.
6. Learn what you can use immediately. No such thing as a "duty to learn"
7. A problem is never solved while sitting at your desk.


Planning & Decision Making
1. Have backups.
2. Choose the plan that let's you change your plans.


Attention
1.The thing you're doing right now is the best thing to be doing, to you.
2. What a million people know isn't worth knowing.
3.If you're rushing or listening to music while learning - it suggests that there's a better way to do it.
4. The thing that people have been doing for 100 years  is probably what will be done 100 years from now.
