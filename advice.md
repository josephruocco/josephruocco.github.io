Health:
1. Food and information is upstream of your thoughts. Control your inputs.
Before trying to think your way out of a problem, try changing your state/inputs.
2. Be wary of anything that feels like addiction
3. I use "Cheat Days" for Web Surfing, drinking caffeine, eating junk food, sitting, etc: Pick one day that you are allowed to break your rule, all other days avoid it.
4. Eat nothing out of the box. No sugar, bread, or pasta. Avoid artificial sweeteners. Avoid canola, vegetable, rapeseed and soybean oils.  No "modern" fruits, the overly sweet ones. eat real foods you enjoy, to prevent you from eating crap. Eat very very large meals on occasion, like Sunday Feasts, while other times skipping meals.
Eat fish. Cyclical omnivores. 
5. No moderate exercise sessions, instead, do lumpy style intense workouts or very, very easy ones. 
6. Very long walks, with occasional sprints.
7. No purely aerobic exercise.
8. Resist people movers. Embrace stairs, avoid elevators. 
9. Don’t take the car to get on the treadmill. Treadmills are cheap/free on craigslist. Use that instead of sitting at a desk.
10.  Go for a walk without your phone.
11. If you don’t feel like doing anything, do the mundane stuff, like doing the laundry, eating healthy meals, taking your vitamins, taking a cold shower, going for a run. Stretch out and deep breathing. Try breathing “behind the shield.” Practice good posture.
12. Use Music, meditation, and exercise to reset mood.
13. The Body craves light volatility. Mild stress of jumping from a small height. Walking on a rocky path. Exposing your body to wind, temperature, and light.
14. I expect a person with a sedentary lifestyle to have at least one of the following problems: insomnia, depression, anxiety or lack of focus.


Failures of Second Order Thinking
1. Taking the car to the gym.
2. Using a dating app that makes money off of keeping you single.
3. Using a meditation app. 

Incentives
1. Beware of the advice that someone gives you; just copy what they actually do.
2. Anything labeled "organic" or "free range", unless explicitly stated 100% ____, then will still probably be about an unhealthy as the inorganic option.


Learning 
1. Prune the daily consumption of these “news” sources from your life: magazines, podcasts, TV, newspapers, web surfing.
2. Learn subjects you're naturally curious about. School should be like a driving test - you just need to pass. Getting a "A" is like trying to be the "best" driver.
3.As soon as a book starts to bore you, switch.
4. Read old books.
5. Acquire as many books as you can possible own.
6. Learn what you can use immediately. No such thing as a "duty to learn"
7. A problem is never solved while sitting at your desk.


Planning & Decision Making
1. Have backups.
2. Choose the plan that let's you change your plans.


Attention
1.The thing you're doing right now is the best thing to be doing, to you.
2. What a million people know isn't worth knowing.
3.If you're rushing or listening to music while learning - it suggests that there's a better way to do it.
4. The thing that people have been doing for 100 years  is probably what will be done 100 years from now.
