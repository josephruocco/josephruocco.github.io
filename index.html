	<h2>About</h2>
	<p> Computer Science is the spark of my curiosity. I am fascinated by power and freedom of programming. </a>

	    <p> Growing up, there were summer mornings in which I would wake up early to use the computers at my local library. I saved up enough money so my parents would let me buy a thing called a "router." A couple years later, when I was 7 years old, I learned about making websites and what people all across the world were making on the internet. I figured I could do something with really useful with programming. </p>

	    <p> To my dismay, the first couple of websites I learned how to make weren't quite that magical. But my curiosity of how this technology works didn't fade. There was so much more to know about technology- How do computers run several processes? How do networks work? How are computers made more efficient? How can I write more code to make software that people can use this information?</p>

	    <p>This interest led me into studying computer science. I am exploring the fintech sector to leverage the power of computing in the world of finance to create secure and efficient experiences for all users.
